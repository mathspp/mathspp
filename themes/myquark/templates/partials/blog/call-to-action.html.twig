My book “Pydon'ts” teaches you how to write elegant, expressive, and Pythonic code.
The book spans across +35 chapters, including hundreds of examples of real code.
And the best thing?
I keep updating and expanding the book!

The book is well worth a couple of dollars but I'm making it free to give back to the community.
I also learned Python on the Internet with free resources!
