# Terms and Conditions

When you purchase a book, a cheatsheet, or a course, you’re not just getting the product itself – you’re also joining a community of Python enthusiasts.

As part of your purchase, you’ll be automatically subscribed to the [**mathspp insider newsletter**](https://mathspp.com/insider).
This is a weekly newsletter where I share in-depth explorations of Python topics, along with occasional updates about new resources I’m creating (such as courses, books, or events).

I believe the newsletter adds real value to your learning journey, which is why I include it for everyone who buys from me.
That said, you’re always in control: if at any point you feel the newsletter isn’t for you, you can unsubscribe with a single click.

Your email will never be shared or sold, and it will only ever be used to send you the [mathspp insider newsletter](https://mathspp.com/insider).

Thank you for trusting me with your learning,\
