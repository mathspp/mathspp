# Accessibility statement

If you are reading this you probably care about accessibility and you probably care about, or could help me with, making my website more accessible.
I am committed to making my website more accessible and, in particular, the blog, so that everyone can make the most out of the content I produce and share online.

I have been taking small steps in order to make my website more accessible, namely

 - the development of dark and light themes you can toggle;
 - using descriptive text for links;
 - adding ALT text to all images (old blog posts may not have them, though); and
 - adding a “copy” button to all code snippets that copies the code to the clipboard.

These are small steps that I hope make some difference for those who need it and I know there are other things I could do to improve things.
(For example, blog articles still have headings with the wrong levels in the wrong order.)

I am absolutely sure there are other things, big and small, that I could implement and that would make all the difference.
But I don't know what those things are, and that's why I need your help.
[Please, reach out to me and educate me](/contact-me?subject=Accessibility%20improvements), so that I can improve things for everyone.
I look forward to your input and I welcome the input of everyone who has first-hand experience with this class of issues or difficulties.
