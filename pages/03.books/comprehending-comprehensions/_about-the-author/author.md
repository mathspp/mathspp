## About the author

I'm **Rodrigo Girão Serrão**, a mathematician and Python educator.  Through my blog [mathspp.com](https://mathspp.com) and my books, I help programmers unlock the full potential of Python.  I love exploring elegant abstractions and explaining them in an approachable way.  When I'm not teaching or writing, you'll find me solving puzzles, tinkering with code, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
