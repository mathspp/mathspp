## About the author

I'm **Rodrigo Girão Serrão**, a mathematician and Python educator.  Through my blog [mathspp.com](https://mathspp.com) and my books, I strive to help programmers think more clearly and solve problems more effectively.  My teaching philosophy revolves around understanding by doing – whether that's building a neural network, mastering comprehensions or tackling coding challenges.  When I'm not teaching or writing, you'll find me solving puzzles, tinkering with code, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
