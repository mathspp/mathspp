By the end of this book you will:

- Understand the building blocks of neural networks: neurons, layers, weights and biases.
- Implement forward and backward propagation and grasp how gradients drive learning.
- Train your own neural network on simple datasets using gradient descent.
- Experiment with hyperparameters like learning rates and architectures to see their impact on performance.
