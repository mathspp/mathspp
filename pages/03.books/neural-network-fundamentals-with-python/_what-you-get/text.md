Here's what you'll get when you dive into **Neural network fundamentals with Python**:

- **Step‑by‑step implementation** – build a simple neural network from scratch and understand each component along the way.
- **Foundational theory explained clearly** – learn about neurons, layers, activation functions and how training works without heavy jargon.
- **Hands‑on experiments** – apply your network to machine learning tasks and explore how different parameters affect learning.
- **Reference code on GitHub** – follow along with a complete implementation that you can extend and modify.
