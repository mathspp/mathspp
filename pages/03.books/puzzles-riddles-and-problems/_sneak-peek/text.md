Here's a sample puzzle to whet your appetite:

> *An ant is at the bottom of a 1 metre long pipe.  Every minute it climbs 3 cm up the inside of the pipe but then slips back 2 cm.  How long does it take the ant to reach the top?*

At first glance you might start adding and subtracting, but the twist comes when the ant finally reaches the top…  The book is full of neat problems like this, and each one comes with a clear explanation of how to get to the answer.
