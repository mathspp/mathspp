## About the author

I'm **Rodrigo Girão Serrão**, a mathematician and Python educator.  I have a soft spot for puzzles and problems that make you think, which is why I collect and share them on my blog [mathspp.com](https://mathspp.com).  My mission is to make learning fun, whether I'm writing about Python, sharing a tricky riddle or exploring mathematical curiosities.  When I'm not teaching or writing, you'll find me solving puzzles, tinkering with code, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
