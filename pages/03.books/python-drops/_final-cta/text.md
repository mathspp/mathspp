## Don't waste this gift

I spend hours researching the Python language, its standard library, and popular projects.
I spend hours distilling the patterns and idioms they use, so that I can share them with you.

You can get access to that distilled knowledge, in bite-sized drops of knowledge, without the fuss:

Or don't, it's up to you!
