## Why did I write this book?

I write [a daily newsletter called “Python drops 🐍💧”](/drops) where I send these tips to people's inboxes.

I know you have to focus on your job, writing actual code, reviewing PRs, debugging issues, and a dozen of other responsibilities.
You don't have the time to do research, so I send a random tip to your inbox so that you can improve by spending 2 minutes reading a tip and digesting the code example.

I got great feedback from the tips I sent, so I started collecting them in this ebook, so that you can reference it and have easy access to the backlog of all the tips I already shared.
