## Why did I write this book?

I write [a daily newsletter called “Python drops 🐍💧”](/drops) where I send these tips to people's inboxes.

I know you have to focus on your job, writing actual code, reviewing PRs, debugging issues, and a dozen of other responsibilities.
You don't have the time to do research, so I do it for you!

Each day, I send a random tip to your inbox so you can reap the benefits without the hassle.
In 2 minutes you read the tip, inspect the diagram, and learn something new!

I got great feedback from the tips I sent, so I started collecting them in this ebook, so that you can reference it and have easy access to the backlog of all the tips I already shared.
