## Swimmy Fish

In this “Flappy Bird” clone the player has to help the fish pass through an infinite series of obstacles that come their way.

Here are some things you'll learn:

- **Physics-Based Movement**: Implement realistic physics-based movement with gravity and velocity, making your game feel more authentic and providing players with a satisfying challenge.
- **Procedural Obstacles**: Learn how to design procedural obstacles that scroll across the screen, offering an endless challenge. This technique is essential for creating replayable games with ongoing difficulty.
- **Scrolling Backgrounds & Parallax Effect**: Add depth to your games using a parallax scrolling effect, where different background layers move at different speeds, giving your game a more immersive and 3D-like feel.
