## Don't buy this book

This short book is not for every Python developer.
If you identify with any of the below, please do not buy this book:

- People who hate fun – If you don’t enjoy making your own mini-games from scratch, this isn't for you.
- Those looking for pre-made solutions – If you want to copy-paste code without understanding how it works, keep scrolling.
- Anti-pythonists – If you think Python is "too slow" or "not a real language," you're better off elsewhere.
- Game dev elitists – If you're expecting to master Unreal or Unity in 50 pages, you're in the wrong place.
- People allergic to creativity – If creating, tweaking, and designing your own games feels like a chore, steer clear.
- Pixel perfectionists – If you can’t handle some raw, unpolished retro charm, this book will drive you nuts.
- Anyone afraid of challenges – If the thought of debugging, problem-solving, and learning something new makes you run, keep running.
- Fans of boring tutorials – If you prefer dry, overly technical guides without personality, this book might be way too engaging for you.
- People expecting AAA graphics – If you're here for photorealistic 3D models, this isn’t your game dev debut.

If you're none of the above, welcome aboard: this book's your next adventure!
