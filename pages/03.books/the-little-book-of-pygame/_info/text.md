## Don't buy this book

This short book is not for every Python developer.
If you identify with any of the below, please do not buy this book:

- **People who hate fun** – If you won't enjoy making your own minigames from scratch, this isn't for you.
- **Those looking for pre-made solutions** – If you want to copy-paste code without understanding how it works, this isn't for you.
- **Anti-pythonistas** – If you think Python is "too slow" for a game you're better off elsewhere.
- **Game dev elitists** – If you're expecting to master Unreal or Unity in 50 pages, you're in the wrong place.
- **People allergic to creativity** – If creating, tweaking, and designing your own games feels like a chore, steer clear.
- **Anyone afraid of challenges** – If the thought of debugging, problem-solving, and learning something new makes you run, keep running.
- **Fans of boring tutorials** – If you prefer dry, overly technical guides without personality, this book might be way too engaging for you.
- **People expecting AAA graphics** – If you're here for photorealistic 3D models and can’t handle some raw, unpolished retro charm, this book will drive you nuts.

If you're none of the above, welcome aboard: this book's your next adventure!
