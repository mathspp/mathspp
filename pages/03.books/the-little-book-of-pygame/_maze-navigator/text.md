## Maze Navigator

In this game the player has to find their way out of a maze without being able to see the whole maze.

Here are some things you'll learn:

- **Procedural Content Generation**: Learn how to generate random mazes using algorithms, giving your game a new layout each time it’s played.
Procedural generation keeps games fresh and unpredictable.
- **Player Movement & Collision Detection**: This game teaches how to implement player movement and handle collisions with walls, a fundamental concept for any game involving exploration or puzzles.
- **Minimap Design**: You’ll create a minimap to give players a sense of orientation, a feature that adds depth to your games by making them more user-friendly and immersive.
