## Maze Navigator

In this book, readers will gain hands-on experience building four unique mini-games, each teaching essential game development concepts and practical features of Pygame. By the end of each game, readers will have expanded their skill set and developed a foundation to bring their creative ideas to life. Here’s what you’ll learn with each project:

- **Procedural Content Generation**: Learn how to generate random mazes using algorithms, giving your game a new layout each time it’s played.
Procedural generation keeps games fresh and unpredictable.
- **Player Movement & Collision Detection**: This game teaches how to implement player movement and handle collisions with walls, a fundamental concept for any game involving exploration or puzzles.
- **Minimap Design**: You’ll create a minimap to give players a sense of orientation, a feature that adds depth to your games by making them more user-friendly and immersive.
