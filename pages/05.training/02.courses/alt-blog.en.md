# Courses

The courses I teach are aimed at getting you to *understand* how things work.
We start with the basics, building the knowledge from the group up,
and always using it to build something:
it is only when you build something, when you use your knowledge to do something,
that you really take it in.

Feel free to [email me][email] to schedule a course or simply to learn more,
I would love to hear from you.
You can also browse all the courses I have prepared below.
