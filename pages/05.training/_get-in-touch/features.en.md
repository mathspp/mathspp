# Get In Touch

I am really passionate about sharing knowledge,
and that is why I love leading workshops and teaching courses
on all things related to mathematics and programming.

I have taught over 600 people for over 45 hours of live teaching
(and that is excluding the hundreds of hours I spent tutoring dozens
of students...),
and here is what a couple of them had to say about their experience:

 > “*It was amazing what we did in just 2 hours [...]
 > In the end I was tired but satisfied with, and fascinated by what I had learned and built.*”
 > &mdash; João Afonso <!--18-->

<!---->

 > “*The explanations were clear and amusing, which made it easy to follow along.*”  &mdash; Madalena Almeida <!--58-->

I am looking forward to hearing from you, so feel free to
[email me](mailto:rodrigo@mathspp.com) if you would like
me to organise a course or workshop with you or if you would like to learn more
about these.
