# Workshops

My workshops are short sessions (generally one to two hours) where I help my audience
explore a predetermined topic, be it recreational mathematics,
a programming language like Python or APL, a tool like GitHub or LaTeX,
or any other topic that is remotely connected to mathematics or programming.

Feel free to [email me][email] to schedule a workshop or simply to learn more,
I would love to hear from you.
You can also have a look at [the workshops][workshops] I already have prepared,
in case you are curious and/or need inspiration.
