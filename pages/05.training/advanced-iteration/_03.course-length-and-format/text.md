## Course length and format

**Course length**: 4 days (32 hours)

All courses offered have a similar format.
The teaching is done without boring slides, but instead through live-coding (typically in a Jupyter notebook).
During the exposition of new concepts or ideas, participants code along and solve small comprehension-check exercises.
At the end of each section, participants are given multiple exercises to work through, to verify their understanding and to cement their learning.

This course can be given remotely or on-site.
