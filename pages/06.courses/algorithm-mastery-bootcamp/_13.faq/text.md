You might be eligible for a Purchasing Power Parity discount which is automatically applied during checkout.

**Please note**: purchase parity pricing (PPP) is for individuals who are paying for their own course.
If your company is paying for you to take this course, please remove the PPP discount during checkout.

<summary><h3>Can I expense this bootcamp with my company?</h3></summary>

Many companies have training or self-development budgets for developers to improve their skills through courses, books, and similar resources.
To figure out if your company will cover the **Algorithm Mastery Bootcamp**, you will have to ask them.

Here is an email template you can use to request company sponsorship:

<summary>Where are the problems taken from?</summary>

The problems will be sourced from the Advent of Code 2025 event, which means we'll be solving problems no one has solved before. This keeps the bootcamp exciting and engaging, as we're all working together to write the best solutions possible.

<summary>I thought Advent of Code lasted 25 days!</summary>

Starting this year, Advent of Code will only go from the 1st of December through the 12th. This is excellent for us because it allows us to have a very intense and focused two weeks of growth.
