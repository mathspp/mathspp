## It's going to be intense

This bootcamp is designed to be **intense**.
To make the most ouf of this experience, you'll need to:

 - solve two programming challenges per day, which might require spending time debugging your own code and double-checking and triple-checking the problem statement to see if you didn't miss anything;
 - read alternative solutions written by other participants to improve your understanding of the problem and possible solutions;
 - help your fellow members of the exclusive bootcamp community;
 - attend the solution walkthrough live session, where I am live coding my solution to the problem; and
 - attend the exclusive solution-analysis live session, where we work together to understand multiple different approaches to the same problem, figure out why some algorithms are better than others, and possibly discuss solutions shared by members of the community.

You don't need to do any of this.
You can paste the problem into ChatGPT and the code might just work...
But then, you won't learn a thing and you'll be stuck where you are right now...
Or worse: your skills will decline.

I'm not trying to scare you.
I honestly just **want you to succeeed** and have **a lot of fun**.
I just want you to make sure you understand you won't have time for Netflix during the bootcamp.
