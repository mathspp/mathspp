## How it works

TL;DR: You solve two problems per day, from December 1st through December 12th.
The problems get harder as the days go by and the final problems are always challenging.

Each day, you get a new programming challenge that you try to solve with Python.
When you solve it, you automatically unlock a new, harder problem.

The second problem is similar to the first problem but forces you to be more careful about your code: if you solved problem 1 with spaghetti code, that won't work for problem 2!
You have to structure your code and your solution in a much better way.

Whenever you get stuck, **you check our exclusive Discord community to ask for help**.

Whenever you finish a problem, you **share your solution** with the community.

**Reading code** teaches a lot, so you want to read the solutions that the other participants wrote!
