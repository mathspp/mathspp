## Catch bugs in your code without running it

**Increase the robustness** of your codebase by using type hints and a static type checker to catch bugs in your programs _without_ even having to run your code.

Learn how to use **flexible type hints** to express the invariants present in your code, so that you can benefit from the dynamic nature of Python and also the **safety** of statically typed code.
