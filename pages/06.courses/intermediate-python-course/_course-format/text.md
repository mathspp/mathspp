## Course format

You will have two 2-hour live sessions per day during a week, for a total of 20 hours of hands-on live sessions.
Between the live sessions you will have assignments to practice the concepts you learned.

As supporting material, you will have access to the recordings of the sessions, the assignments to practice, and a private discussion forum to get help from me and the other students for your assignments.

 - **Next cohort**: 31st March – 4th April.
 - **Price**: $490 – includes access to the live sessions and lifelong access to the session recordings, assignments, and discussion forum.
 - **Spots available**: 15 participants – this allows me to give personalised attention to everyone.
