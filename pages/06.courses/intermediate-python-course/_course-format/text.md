## Course format

You will have two 2-hour live sessions per day during a week, for a total of 20 hours of hands-on live sessions.
As supporting material, you will have access to the recordings of the sessions, assignments to practice the concepts you learn, and a private discussion forum to get help from me and the other students for your assignments.

The next cohort will take place from the 31st of March to the 4th of April and it is limited to 15 participants, to ensure I can give personalised attention to everyone.
