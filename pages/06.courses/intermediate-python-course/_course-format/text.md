## Live sessions

You will have a total of 20 hours of live sessions where you learn about new tools and concepts.
Then, you will have assignments to practice the tools and concepts you learned between live sessions.

Each live session lasts 2 hours and you have 2 per day, which means you have 4 hours of live sessions per day during a full week.


## Supporting material

As supporting material, you will have access to the recordings of the sessions, the assignments to practice, and a private discussion forum to get help from me and the other students for your assignments.
