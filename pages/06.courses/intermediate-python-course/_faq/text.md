## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### What's the difference between the intensive and paced versions?

The content of the course is exactly the same.
What changes is the time span over which the live sessions take place.
The intensive course takes place in a single week, with 4 hours of live sessions per day.
The paced course spans over 3 weeks (Friday of week 1, Tuesday + Friday of week 2, and Tuesday + Friday of week 3) with 4 hours of live sessions for each of the mentioned days.
Regardless of the version you choose, when the course is over you keep access to the course resources, like live session recordings and exercises.


### At what time will the live sessions take place?

The live sessions take place from 3pm to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm, UTC time.


### Where will the course take place?

The live sessions will take place on Zoom (the link for the meeting will be provided after you sign-up).
The assignments will be hosted in a private GitHub repository and the discussion forum will be the associated GitHub Discussions page.


### What are the prerequisites for the course?

This course assumes you are comfortable with programming and you know your way around Python; this is not a course for complete beginners.

The type of people who will benefit the most from this course include people who use Python to get things done but who are always putting out fires and don't have the time to learn Python best practices, or people who have been programming with other languages for some time and are transitioning to Python.


### What time commitment is expected of me?

You will make the most of this course if you have time to attend the live sessions and work on the assignments between live sessions.
If you don't set aside time to learn you will never make visible progress.
So, expect a challenging but fun couple of days.


### Are there any discounts?

The course has purchasing parity pricing (PPP) enabled, so you might get a discount based on the cost of living and local currency of where you are located.
(This requires you to use a payment method from the same country you're located in, to prevent fraud.)

If you are a student or are unemployed, you are eligible for an additional discount; just [email me](mailto:rodrigo@mathspp.com) with proof of your unemployment/student status and I will send you a discount code.
