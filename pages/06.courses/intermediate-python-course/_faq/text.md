## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### At what time will the live sessions take place?

The live sessions will take place from [3pm to 5pm](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/event?lid=100&h=100&sts=29056320&sln=15-17&a=preview "Follow the link to check the time in your own time zone.") and [7pm to 9pm](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/event?lid=100&h=100&sts=29056320&sln=19-21&a=preview "Follow the link to check the time in your own time zone."), UTC time.


### Where will the course take place?

The live sessions will take place on Zoom (the link for the meeting will be provided later).
The assignments will be hosted in a private GitHub repository and the discussion forum will be the associated GitHub Discussions page.


### What are the prerequisites for the course?

This course assumes you are comfortable with programming and you know your way around Python; this is not a course for complete beginners.

The type of people who will benefit the most from this course include people who use Python to get things done but who are always putting out fires and don't have the time to learn Python best practices, or people who have been programming with other languages for some time and are transitioning to Python.


### What time commitment is expected of me?

You will make the most of this course if you have time to attend the live sessions and work on the assignments between live sessions.
This means the course will take most of your week and I know that's a big time commitment...
After the week ends, you will still have access to the live session recordings, the assignments, and the discussion forum...
But!
If you don't set aside time to learn you will never make visible progress.

So, expect a challenging but fun and rewarding week.
