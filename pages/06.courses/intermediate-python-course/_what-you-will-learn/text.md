## What you will learn

When you finish the course you will be able to

 - write code that is more time- and memory-efficient by leveraging generators and better looping techniques;
 - code idiomatically by leveraging the most useful tools from the standard library;
 - write modular and reusable code by learning practical OOP techniques, decorators, and more;
 - structure your functions, classes, files, and projects, in a way that is easy to manage;
 - detect bugs even before running your code by using typing and static analysis with mypy; and
 - package your code to share privately across your own projects or publically with every single Python users.

This will only be possible because the course goes beyond theory.
During the live sessions, I introduce new concepts and tools with **live coding and examples**, but the true learning will happen after the live sessions.
That is when you will get your hands dirty as you work on **hands-on assignments**.
