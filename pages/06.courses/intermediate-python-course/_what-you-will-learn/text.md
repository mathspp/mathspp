## What you will learn

 - Write code that is more time- and memory-efficient by leveraging generators and better looping techniques.
 - Code idiomatically by leveraging the most useful tools from the standard library.
 - Write modular and reusable code by learning practical OOP techniques, decorators, and more.
 - Structure your functions, classes, files, and projects, in a way that is easy to manage.
 - Detect bugs even before running your code by using typing and static analysis with mypy.
 - Package your code to share privately across your own projects or publically with every single Python users.

This course goes beyond theory – you’ll apply what you learn immediately through **live coding, hands-on assignments, and real-world projects**.
