### Week 4 — Type hints

- **Session 7**, 24th March 3–5pm UTC: catch bugs even before running your code by adding type hints to your code and using a static type checker.
- **Session 8**, 26th March 3–5pm UTC: learn how to write flexible type hints that encode the relationships that your variables and function arguments satisfy.

### Week 5 — Projects & packaging

- **Session 9**, 31st March 3–5pm UTC: learn how to run tools in isolated environments, avoid dependency-hell when working with scripts, and create Python projects.
