## About the instructor

Hi, I'm Rodrigo GirÃ£o SerrÃ£o from sunny Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

I've been using Python for 10 or 11 years now and writing about it for 7 or 8 [on my blog](/blog).
I also [self-published 8+ books](/books) and [given multiple talks](/talks) at the largest Python conferences of the world.

I have extensive experience teaching people from all walks of life â€“ from kids in school to retirees â€“ and there is a consensus: my students tend to enjoy my clear examples, my live coding during the sessions, and most surprisingly, my quirky sense of humour.
