Each week you have two 2h live sessions.

The live sessions are designed to be engaging and will teach you everything you need to know.
No slides, only live-coding.
And you'll solve practical exercises right there, in the sessions.

You also get access to written reference materials, to act as a memory refresher, and exercises to practice between sessions.
