## What you'll learn

The course revolves around some core concepts that you'll learn about and practice throughout the week:

 - **Better looping**: Write code that is more time- and memory-efficient by leveraging generators and better looping techniques.
 - **Standard library**: Code idiomatically by leveraging the most useful tools already available to you.
 - **Modularity and composability**: Write modular and reusable code by learning practical OOP techniques, decorators, and more.
 - **Typing**: Detect bugs even before running your code by using typing and static analysis with mypy.
 - **Project management**: Structure your functions, classes, files, and projects, in a way that is easy to manage.
 - **Packaging**: Package your code to share privately across your own projects or publically with every single Python users.

This will only be possible because the course goes beyond theory.
During the live sessions, I introduce new concepts and tools with **live coding and examples**, but the true learning will happen after the live sessions.
That is when you will get your hands dirty as you work on **hands-on assignments**.
