## Write modular and composable code

Design code that is easy to test and reason about, and that you can reuse in your project and across projects.

- **Streamline your functions**: apply the single-responsibility principle to write functions that are modular, easy to test and reason about, and that you can apply across multiple scenarios and contexts.
- **Abstract away orthogonal behaviour**: use decorators to abstract useful logic into components you can easily apply to other functions and classes in your codebase without having to repeat yourself over and over and over and over again. (See what I did there?)
- **Make better architectural decisions**: understand when to use inheritance and when to use composition in your own code, allowing you to develop systems that are more flexible.
