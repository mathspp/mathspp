This course is for all developers who can write small functions, programs, and scripts, but struggle to create larger or more complex projects.
This course will focus on equipping you with all the tools that a fluent Python developer uses, from syntactic features that the language provides to tools and workflows that make you a better and more productive developer.

You will learn skills to help you

 - write code that is more time and memory efficient;
 - code idiomatically by leveraging the most useful tools from the standard library;
 - write modular and reusable code;
 - structure your functions, classes, files, and projects, in a way that is easy to manage;
 - detect bugs even before running your code; and
 - package your code to share privately across your own projects or publically with every single Python users.

The focus will be on understanding the underlying principles and then applying them immediately with the exercises and small projects presented.

Some of the topics covered in this course include the module `itertools` and generators, practical OOP techniques, decorators, the essentials of static typing with mypy, testing with pytest, and project management and packaging with uv.

This course lasts 5 business days, with 4 hours of live sessions per day (in two sessions of 2 hours each), plus assignments and exercises to get you to practice the concepts learned.
The live sessions are live-coded and very hands-on because you learn when you practice, not when you listen to others/read.

The course includes access to a discussion forum to get help with the exercises outside of the live sessions.
