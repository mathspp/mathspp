This is an intermediate Python course that's perfect for you if you already have some experience in Python.
This course will focus on equipping you with all the tools that a fluent Python developer uses, from syntactic features that the languagtte provides to tools and workflows that make you a better and more productive developer.

Some of the topics covered in this course include the module `itertools` and generators, practical OOP techniques, decorators, the essentials of static typing and mypy, testing with pytest, and project management and packaging with uv.

The focus will be on understanding the underlying principles and then applying them immediately with the exercises and small projects presented.

This course lasts 5 business days, with 4 hours of live sessions per day (in two sessions of 2 hours each), plus assignments and exercises to get you to practice the concepts learned.
The live sessions are live-coded and very hands-on because you learn when you practice, not when you listen to others/read.

The course includes access to a discussion forum to get help with the exercises outside of the live sessions.
