In this live-coded talk I answered the question of “how do you create an animation from first principles”?

We started out by only being able to draw pixels on the screen and by the time the clock was over, we could animate the rotating spiral that is shown on the side.

An attendee wrote “The talk was really dynamic and the idea of programming while talking was awesome.”
