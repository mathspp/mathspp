In this talk I share my experience working on a FOSS project full-time for 503, sharing some of the non-technical lessons I learned along the way.

These lessons fall into 4 broad categories:

 1. how to get a tech job;
 2. how to manage your ego;
 3. how to interact with users; and
 4. how to work with a big codebase.
