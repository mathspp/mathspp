In this live-coding talk I wanted to explain how descriptors work by establishing a parallel with properties.
Although properties _are_ descriptors, this approach is how descriptors clicked for me and I was hoping it would help descriptors click for others as well.

Coming into the talk, I wasn't sure if I should present it as a live-coding demo, but Barry's feedback tells me I made the right choice:

 > “Used descriptors before but this [talk] clarified a lot. Live coding is hard to do, but makes it a better experience. Thanks for that.”
