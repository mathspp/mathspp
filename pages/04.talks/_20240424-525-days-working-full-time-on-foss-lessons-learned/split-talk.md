In this talk I share non-technical lessons I learned after working on a FOSS project full-time for +500 days.
These lessons fall into 4 broad categories:

 1. how to get a tech job;
 2. how to manage your ego;
 3. how to interact with users; and
 4. how to work with a big codebase.

This is an improved version of [the same talk](/talks#503-days-working-full-time-on-foss-lessons-learned) I gave at PyCon Lithuania 2024.
