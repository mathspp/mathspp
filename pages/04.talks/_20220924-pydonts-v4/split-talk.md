title: "Pydon'ts â€“ Write elegant Python code v4"
event: "PyCon Portugal 2022"

I was scheduled to give this talk in person but I had a family emergency and couldn't attend.
Later, I recorded the talk at home and made it unofficially available online.

In this Python talk, I continuously refactored a piece of code by using Python features elegantly.
