In this talk, I use an example from the Django framework to motivate the need for descriptors in the Python language.
Then, I proceed to explain the descriptor protocol, tying it to the original motivating example, through a live-coded demonstration.

The objective of the talk is to make sure the audience understands that frameworks (like Django) rely heavily on Python features (like descriptors) to operate their machinery.
