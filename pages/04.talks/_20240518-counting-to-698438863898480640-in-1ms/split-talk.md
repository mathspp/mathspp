In this lightning talk I try to tease the audience into wondering how one might solve large combinatorial problems in an efficient manner.
To that end, I ask how many passwords there are with lengths between 8 and 10, with at least one upper case letter, at least one lower case letter, and one digit.

After an attempt at suspense, I show 6 lines of code and arrive at the answer of 698,438,863,898,480,640 in 0.4ms.
