title: "Atuin - Magical Shell History"
# via:
---

Just found out about Atuin 5 minutes ago, I installed it 3 minutes ago, and I'm already sold.
I don't even know all of the things that I can do with Atuin, but one thing is clear right off the bat: searching my console history with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> is now something that looks intuitive and that has a great interface.

Before, I always struggled to search my shell history and the functionality is limited.
Those days are long gone...
