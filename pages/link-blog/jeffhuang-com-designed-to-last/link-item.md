title: "This Page is Designed to Last: A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web"
# via:

This piece by Jeff Huang got me thinking about the structure of my own blog, how I maintain it, and how to make sure the content lasts for as long as possible on the web.
Jeff shares seven aspirations that make his “manifesto for a long-lasting website”:

1. return to vanilla HTML/CSS
2. don't minimise the HTML
3. prefer one page over several
4. end all forms of hotlinking
5. stick with native fonts
6. obsessively compress your images
7. eliminate the broken URL risk

Looking at these aspirations and the extended explanations that Jeff includes it's clear that one of the main themes is removing as much dependency as possible on external tools, pages, assets, etc.
