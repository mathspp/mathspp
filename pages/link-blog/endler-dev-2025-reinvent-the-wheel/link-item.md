This article resonated a lot with me because Matthias is advocating for an idea that I also support 100%: the idea that you should reinvent the wheel for the sake of improving your own understanding of things.

In this article, Matthias goes on to provide a series of strong arguments in favour of reinventing the wheel from time to time, but for me two key ones really are the fact that building things from scratch is:

 1. a LOT of fun; and
 2. an amazing learning opportunity.

I preach these two ideas a lot but I also practice them.
For example, roughly [two weeks ago I was at PyCon US 2025 giving a tutorial](/blog/personal-highlights-of-pycon-us-2025) whose main premise was that you'd learn a lot about iteration if you tried to reimplement the module `itertools`.
