Today I was chatting with [Hugo van Kemenade](https://hugovk.dev) and he told me about a couple of “useless” bots he developed a while ago.

The deployment of these harmless bots had all sorts of curious repercussions and I hope Hugo shares these stories with the Internet (maybe through a blog article or a lightning talk at a PyCon conference), so that you can also have a good laugh like I did!

One of the bots that Hugo mentioned took hip hop lyrics and matched them with sentences from the Project Gutenberg, and this link should show you some samples as entertaining as this one:

 > “Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write
 > 
 > But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a knight.”
