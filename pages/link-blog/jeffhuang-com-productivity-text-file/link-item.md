title: "My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file"
# via:

I've been trying to get used to Obsidian as my note-taking app for a long time now and after reading this article by Jeff Huang I realise that Obsidian really hasn't been working for me and it feels like it never will.
The simple worfklow that Jeff describes sounds ridiculous – a 50,000 line TXT document, really? – but at the same time it sounds so liberating...
It's just a text file...

Maybe I'll give it a go.
