I enjoy the stuff that Simon writes and in his newsletter he introduced me to a concept I didn't even know: “link blogging”.
I decided to give it a try and so I thought it was only fitting to start by blogging about this link of his.

At least for now, I think I'll stick to a simpler workflow to see if I enjoy link blogging and in the future I might extend the way I go about this...
