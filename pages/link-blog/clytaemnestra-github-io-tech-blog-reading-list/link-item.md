I met Mia in a Python conference – possibly EuroPython – and was quite interested in seeing what she had read.
My interest in her article increased when I realised she read some books that are in my "to read" list, like “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss or “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie.
Reading her reviews also brought to my attention a couple of other books, like “TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking” by Chris Anderson.
