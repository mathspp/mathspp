In this short article Audrey shares how she used an LLM to automatically rename her dozens of Python notebooks that were untitled.
This was a nice short read because it's always good to see how others use LLMs to make their lives easier.

Did she end up saving more time than if she had opened the notebooks and renamed them one by one?
I can't know for sure.
Probably not, since she only had to rename 32 notebooks.

But the coded approach was certainly more enjoyable and now she has a script she can rerun if needed in the future.
