I liked reading this PEP because I'm a big fan of trying to have things as organised as possible and the introduction of a module `math.integer` looks like it makes sense. I also found it funny how they're mentioning the possibility of adding a function `fibonacci` to this module, which would render the interview question “Please implement a Fibonacci function in Python” completely moot.
