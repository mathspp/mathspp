This short TED talk by Chris Voss, author of “Never Split the Difference”, renewed my interest in his book.
In this TED talk, he mostly talks about what he calls “tactical empathy”, the act of listening to others, trying to understand their feelings, and making them feel heard, without necessarily agreeing with what they are saying.

In this talk, Chris Voss tells two or three stories that show the value of practicing tactical empathy, whether with a terrorist – Chris Voss was an FBI hostage negotiator – or with someone from your family.
