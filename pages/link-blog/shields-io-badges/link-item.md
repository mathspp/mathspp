The shields.io website is the provider of all those badges you see online, typically on GitHub README files and profiles:

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20version-3.14-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-mathspp.com-white) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-failing-red)

To generate these, you can go to <https://shields.io/badges> to build the URL with the query parameters to define the badge you want.
The samples above don't even scratch the surface of what you can do with these badges!
