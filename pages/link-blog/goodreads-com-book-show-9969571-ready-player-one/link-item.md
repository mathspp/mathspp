[“Ready Player One” came out as a movie directed by Steven Spielberg in 2018](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/) and ignorant me thought it was just a movie.
A friend told me it was inspired by a book and since I enjoyed the movie, he thought I'd enjoy the book as well.

I read the book and I enjoyed it even more than I enjoyed the movie.
There were some clear differences, especially when it came to the progression of the Easter Egg hunt, which the whole book/movie revolves around.
I preferred the challenges as written on the book, which appealed more to the geek in me, but I totally understand why they made the changes they made for the movie, which I think worked out quite well.

Next up on my reading list: “Ready Player Two”.
