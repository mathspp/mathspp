I was preparing a webinar on typing (for the [Python Mastery Guild](https://skool.com/python-mastery)) and I was thinking about duck typing and how to explain it.
I had come to the realisation – which is kind of obvious in hindsight – that dunder methods _are_ for duck typing.
It's through dunder methods that you add the duck-like behaviours that matter to your own classes.
Not surprisingly, Trey's article on duck typing presents the same conclusion in a later section of the article.
