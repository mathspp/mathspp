This browser game is a rendition of Tetris with a very interesting mechanic.
All blocks are rectangular and instead of rotating them, you can rearrange their widths and lengths while keeping their area the same.
As an example, sometimes a 15x1 block will start falling and you can rearrange it as a 5x3, 3x5, or 1x15, block.
