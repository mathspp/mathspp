title: "“Writing for Developers: Blogs that get read” book on Goodreads"
---

I read the book “Writing for Developers” as part of [Phil Eaton's book club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html).
I liked the tips that the authors give on how to work a draft and how to share your work once it's published, but I don't think this needed to be a 400-page book.
It was way too long and I expected it to contain more advice on the act of writing itself.
