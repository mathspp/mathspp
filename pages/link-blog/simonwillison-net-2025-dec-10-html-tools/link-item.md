title: "Useful patterns for building HTML tools"
# via:
---

This blog article by Simon lists a couple dozen patterns that Simon figured out while using LLMs to build his HTML tools, a pattern [I stole to use myself](https://tools.mathspp.com) as well.
Some of the patterns he mentions I already knew, like storing state in the URL, but there are others I hadn't thought about yet, like having the tool generate files in whatever format might be useful and then downloading them!
