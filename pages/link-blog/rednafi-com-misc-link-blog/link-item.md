One more “meta link” in this link blog, Redowan shares his approach to link blogging.
Since he's using a static site, he has a markdown file where he blogs about all of the links for a given year.
Then, somehow, the theme/tools he uses also turn that page into a nicer, shorter “feed” that allows to easily glance over all the links he blogged about.

This approach is different from mine.
Since I have a dynamic website, I have a small markdown file per link and then the CMS I'm using (Grav, at the time of writing) takes all those short snippets and puts them together.
