title: "How Stanford Teaches AI-Powered Creativity in Just 13 Minutes"
# via:

In this video, Jeremy Utley from Stanford shares some insights on how he teaches students to work with AI.

Maybe one of the most fundamental ideas he shares is that it helps to think of LLMs as “teammates” when interacting with them.
For example, when an LLM produces a mediocre result, you shouldn't dismiss it.
Instead, you can act as you would if that had been produced by a teammate: you give feedback and suggestions for improvements, which tends to lead the LLM to produce better results.

Another idea I liked from the video is a seventh grader definition of creativity.
According to an anonymous seventh grader, creativity is doing more than the first thing you think of, and then Jeremy proceeds to building on top of this idea and saying that with LLMs it is now easier than ever to arrive at “good enough” on the first try, and if you are aiming for excellent you need to fight against the tendency to settle for the first result you get.
