In this article, the author shares some tools they use and that have allowed them to greatly simplify their `.bashrc` configuration file.

For me, the main thing(s) I took from the article are the tools shared, and that I am going to try out.
I started using [Atuin](https://atuin.sh), a shell history handler, a couple of weeks ago based on a recommendation from this same author; now, the article mentions starship (which I also use already), ripgrep (an alternative to `grep`), fd (an alternative to `find`), and `fzf`, a universal fuzzy finder that I'm installing as I type these words.
