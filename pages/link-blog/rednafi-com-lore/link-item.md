In this article, Redowan shares a number of wisdoms, aphorisms, and observations, quotes frequently in conversations about software, philosophy, and ways of working.

Of the ones I didn't know, my favourite one was [the Beyoncé rule](https://rednafi.com/lore/#the-beyoncé-rule):

 > If you want to be confident that a system exhibits a particular behavior, the only way to be sure it will is to write an automated test for it. Google calls it the Beyoncé Rule. Succinctly, it can be stated as follows: “If you liked it, then you shoulda put a test on it.”
