The ELIZA effect, named after the [ELIZA chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), is the “tendency to project human traits — such as experience, semantic comprehension or empathy — onto rudimentary computer programs having a textual interface”.

With LLMs on the rise and with their usage spreading among non-technical people, I have a feeling that fighting this ELIZA effect will be both crucial and impossible.
If the ELIZA chatbot was as basic as it was and it managed to affect its users in such a way that they named the effect after the chatbot, I can't imagine what LLMs will do to the general population...
