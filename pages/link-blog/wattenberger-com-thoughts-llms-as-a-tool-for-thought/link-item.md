In this visually stunning article, Amelia proposes we use LLM chatbots as a tool for thought; as a sparring partner that helps us think through different ideas and topics.

Amelia puts forward some good points in favour of this suggestion, like the fact that LLM chatbots will remember the context of our conversation regardless of whether I take 5 minutes to reply or 5 weeks, which means I can stick to the cadence that is most convenient to me.
This, and other arguments in favour of using LLM chatbots as a tool for thought, are accompanied by small interactive widgets that help the author make their points.

A stunning piece and a wonderful read.
