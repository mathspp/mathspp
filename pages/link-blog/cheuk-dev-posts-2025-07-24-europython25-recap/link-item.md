This article by Cheuk mentions some of the things that Cheuk enjoyed the most about the EuroPython 2025 conference.
At the time of writing this, I haven't written the article with my personal highlights of the conference but I share one of the main sentiments that Cheuk expresses, which is that EuroPython would not be possible without the help of the 100+ volunteers who pour that heart and soul into the conference during the months leading to the conference, during the week of the conference, and for some, even _after_ the conference.
