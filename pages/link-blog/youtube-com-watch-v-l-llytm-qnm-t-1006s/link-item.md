[Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca) [attributes himself](https://opensource.snarky.ca/About+Me/Frequently+Asked+Questions#Who+are+you%3F) the phrase “I came for the language, but stayed for the community” that he says around the 16:46 minute mark of the linked video.

I liked finding out about this because I always say this phrase to folks, so it's neat knowing where it comes from.
