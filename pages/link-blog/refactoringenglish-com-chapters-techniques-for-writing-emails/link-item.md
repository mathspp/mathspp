In this post, Michael shares 5 techniques to write more effective emails:

 1. Deliver the most important information first.
 2. Use the [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com) browser extension.
 3. Write complete replies rather than quick ones.
 4. Split threads and curate recipients.
 5. Create structure with headings and paragraph breaks.

The point about delivering the most important information first makes sense and is akin to the inverted pyramid scheme that journalists tend to use, where the info that is more relevant to more people is presented first.
Then, as you keep reading, you get to the pieces of information that are relevant to less and less people.
