I enjoyed learning more about the way the brain works and how it adapts and evolves.
As an example, I enjoyed learning about all of the different ways in which people tried to overcome sensorial shortcomings they had, and how some tried to enhance their own senses, and the work that the brain puts in to start processing these new inputs and to make sense of them.
As I understood, it looks like you can just “plug in” new inputs to your brain and your brain will learn to process them, much in the way it learned to process the input from your eyes, from your ears, from your skin, etc.
It receives signals and as you interact with the world those signals change, so you learn useful associations, like hitting the door hurts or that petting an animal is nice.
That's how I understood it, at least...
