I was trying to implement a pure-CSS masonry layout for a page of my site where I'd display reviews and testimonials and I found the this masonry layout page, but apparently it's a very experimental feature.
At least, at the time of writing this.
You can get this in Firefox by manually enabling a flag and Safari has experimental support for it, but it looks like all other major browsers don't even support this in any way, shape, or form.
