In this short article the author shares some tips on using uv.
Since I'm starting to really lean on uv and trying to learn how to use it best in my workflows, I appreciated going through some of the common commands that uv provides and some example use cases.

I was particularly happy with the fact that the author shared [my blog article on how to use uv to install globally-available Python CLIs](/blog/using-uv-to-build-and-install-python-cli-apps).
