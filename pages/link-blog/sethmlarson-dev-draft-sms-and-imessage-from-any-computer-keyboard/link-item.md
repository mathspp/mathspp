This small tool allows you to write a text message on your computer.
As you type, a QR code on the right of the page is being generated to encode the text message you want to send.
Once you're done typing _on your computer_ you scan the QR code with your phone and it automatically opens the “messages” app on your phone with the text and recipient(s) you typed.
