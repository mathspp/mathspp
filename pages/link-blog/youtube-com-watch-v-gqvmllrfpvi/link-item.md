In this video, Simon shares a screencast of him creating and deploying a little RTF to HTML converter tool.

What I enjoyed the most about the video was seeing his `tools.simonwillison.net` page that is a GitHub Pages website (on his personal domain) with lots of little HTML tools that he vibe coded.
This is a cool pattern that I might steal in the future...
