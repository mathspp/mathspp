title: "And now for something completely different"
# via:

In this blog article, Hugo – the release manager for Python 3.14 and 3.15 – compiled all of his “And now for something completely different” sections for the Python 3.14 release notes, including a plethora of facts about pi ($\pi$), pies, and the bird magpie.

My favourite one is a direct quotation from Pablo Galindo Salgado's PyCon Greece keynote, where Pablo presents an alternative definition of pi in terms of the maximum time an object can take to fall into a black hole.
