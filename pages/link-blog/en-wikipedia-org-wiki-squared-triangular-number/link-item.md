With 2025 almost starting, I've seen a number of people talking about the fact that $2025 = 45^2$, and since $45$ is a [triangular number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number), that gives rise to two fun formulas to compute $2025$.
First, since $45$ is a triangular number, you get

$$
2025 = 45^2 = (1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 8 + 9)^2 ~ .
$$

The link to the Wikipedia page about squared triangular numbers also gives a beautiful geometrical demonstration that the formula above is equal to the sum of the cubes of the same integers:

$$
2025 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + 8^3 + 9^3 ~ .
$$
