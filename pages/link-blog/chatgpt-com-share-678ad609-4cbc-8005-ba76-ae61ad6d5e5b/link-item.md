title: "ChatGPT conversation to automate testimonials"

Today I interacted with ChatGPT to create a page on my website where anyone can leave a testimonial for my work.
When you submit the form, a custom Grav plugin runs to convert the form replies into a suitable format that I can display in the wall of testimonials.

Since I don't know PHP, I got ChatGPT to help me with this and in the end we got a working solution.
Just head on over to [the testimonials page](/testimonials) and you'll see what I'm talking about.
