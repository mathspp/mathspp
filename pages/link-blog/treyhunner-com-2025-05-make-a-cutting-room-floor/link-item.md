In this article, Trey talks about his writing process and what he calls his cutting room floor.
Trey writes in three phases:

 1. drafting;
 2. researching; and
 3. editing.

When editing, Trey often finds it hard to delete paragraphs/sections/code/... that he already wrote but that no longer fit well within the full picture.
Instead of deleting everything outright, Trey cuts those sections into a separate document he calls the cutting room floor.
By moving the content there, Trey can easily revive it or adapt it if need be; it's also easier to move text to a different document than it is to delete it.

After reading this article by Trey, I'm wondering if it would make sense for me to create a sort of cutting room floor, but then let the pasted contents stay there as possible inspiration for future content.
