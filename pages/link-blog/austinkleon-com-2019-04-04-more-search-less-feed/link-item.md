This short article gets you to think about the differences between browsing a feed, like a news feed or the feed of a social media app, versus browsing search results.

When browsing a feed, you browse random stuff that was pushed to you by the people, companies, and organisations that published those pieces of information.
Typically, you didn't ask for that info on those topics; an algorithm just decided to present it to you.

On the other hand, when you are searching, you make a concrete decision of what to search for.
You browse results of _your_ search.
You decide what to read and what not to read.
You played a part in what information is shown to you.
