In Portugal there is a typical dish called [“francesinha”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha), and the literal translation of the name “francesinha” means “little French woman”, which is a bit of a weird name for a dish.
When I commented about this with a group of Frenchmen, and when I explained what the dish consisted of, they remarked “Oh, that sounds like the Portuguese version of a Welsh”.

After Googling for a Welsh and after finding out it's kind of similar to a francesinha, I find it amusing that the Brits and the French eat a dish called “Welsh” and we eat a vaguely similar dish called “little French woman”.
