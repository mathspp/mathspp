title: "14 Advanced Python Features"
# via:

In this article, the author covers 14 Python features and briefly shows how to use them.
It's arguable whether the 14 features presented really are “advanced”, but the features presented are definitely useful.

The highlights for me were the features related to typing (overloads, protocols, and generics) and the fact that my own blog was used as a reference for a subsection on comparison operator chaining!
