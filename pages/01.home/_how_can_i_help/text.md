# How can I help _you_?

I want to help _you_ take your Python 🐍 skills to the next level. 🚀

Most people start by downloading my free book “[Pydon'ts – write elegant Python code][pydonts]”, which has over 190 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews.
If you get that book and become a [mathspp insider][insider], like +16,000 others have, your Python code will improve so much that you won't even recognise it.

However, every person is different.
Your background and your goals are specific to you.
If you reach out to me – on [Twitter], [LinkedIn], by [email], or any other means —, we can chat and I can point you to the resources that are more appropriate for you.
