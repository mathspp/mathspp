I want to help _you_ take your Python 🐍 skills to the next level. 🚀

Every person is different.
Your background and your goals are specific to you.
If you reach out to me – on [Twitter], [LinkedIn], by [email], or any other means —, we can chat and I can point you to the resources that are more appropriate for you.

However, most people start by downloading my free book “[Pydon'ts – write elegant Python code][pydonts]”, which has over 190 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews.
If you get that book and join +16,000 others in becoming a [mathspp insider][insider], your Python code will improve so much that you won't even recognise it.
