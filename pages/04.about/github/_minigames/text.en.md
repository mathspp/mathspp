# Minigames

I enjoy writing minigames as little programming projects. I have written several of them in Python + pygame and a couple of them using the Processing Java library.

Some of my favourite ones include my [pigeon simulator], [HueHue] and [Minesweeper]. To the right you can see a screenshot of my Minesweeper remake and below a screenshot of my pigeon simulator.
