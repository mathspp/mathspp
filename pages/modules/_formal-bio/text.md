Hi, I'm Rodrigo Girão Serrão from sunny Portugal 🇵🇹.

I'm a prolific Python author and speaker, with [multiple books published independently](/books) and [dozens of talks and tutorials](/talks) given at the largest Python conferences in the world.
I also [blog frequently about Python](/blog) and publish two Python newsletters: the [mathspp insider](/insider) and the daily [Python drops 🐍💧](/drops).

I have extensive experience teaching people from all walks of life – from kids in school, to professionals in various industries, to retirees – and there is a clear consensus that my students enjoy my clear examples, the live-coding during my lessons, and most surprisingly: my quirky sense of humour.
