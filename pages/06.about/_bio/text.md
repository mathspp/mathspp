## How it started

Hi! Thanks for joining me in my corner of the Internet.

I have been sharing knowledge, in one way or another, since I was 6.
I remember the frustration I felt when a classmate asked a question, the teacher answered something that completely missed the point, and then I whispered back an explanation that actually clicked for my colleague.

Now, I share my knowledge out in the open with people from all around the world.
