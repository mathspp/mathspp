## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rodrigo

... and I've always been fascinated by problem solving.
That is why I picked up programming â€“ so that I could solve more problems.

I also love sharing knowledge, and that is why I spend so much time writing articles for the [mathspp blog](/blog), [writing books](/books), sharing Python tips on Twitter [@mathsppblog](https://twitter.com/mathsppblog), and giving Python trainings.

I'm currently obsessed with comprehensions, generators, and the module `itertools`.
While I was getting my MSc in applied mathematics, my main area of scientific interest was numerical analysis (numerical methods for partial differential equations are fun!).
I also enjoy reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies, and eating chocolate.
