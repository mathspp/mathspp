## Fun facts

Here are some random fun facts about me:

- On the 1st of January of 2023 I decided I'd stop drinking sodas.
 Since then, I only drank a soda _once_, on a trip to Denmark.
- After doing virtually no exercise for some years, on the 1st of January of 2024 I decided to start exercising regularly.
 I signed up at a CrossFit gym – which everyone close to me thought was utterly unlike me – and I actually took to it.
- I have gotten jobs in online chatrooms, on Twitter, and through meeting random people at events and conferences, but never by going through a “standard” job application process.
- I started publishing my books online after meeting a fellow independent author on Reddit who pushed me to do it. My free book [“Pydon'ts – Write elegant Python code”](/books/pydonts) was the first book I ever published independently.
