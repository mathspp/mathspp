## Python is easy, but learning Python isn't...

I started learning Python when I was 15 because a friend casually walked up to me and said “Rodrigo, you should learn Python. I think you will like it.”.

That's it.
I started learning Python and soon realised my friend was right.

But it was difficult to learn Python on the Internet without guidance.
“What do you learn next?
Is this a good article on this topic?
What tools do I need to learn about?”
I'm sure you relate to these difficulties.

## And it's getting harder...

With ChatGPT and other LLMs pumping out subpar content, my promise to you is that I will keep writing about Python and teaching Python in my unique way, simplifying complex topics with analogies and examples that make sense to you.

I confess I have an obsessive nature.
But it's what makes me spend thousands of hours researching and thinking about Python, its tools, and its related concepts.
I spend thousands of hours researching and reflecting, and then I distil everything into content you can consume confidently:

- I've [written 8 books](/books) about Python, programming, and mathematics.
- My [book “Pydon'ts – Write elegant Python code”](/books/pydonts) has been downloaded by over 40,000 developers.
- I have given talks and tutorials at [dozens of international Python conferences](/talks), including PyCon US, EuroPython, PyData Global, and PyCons all over Europe.
- I share Python tips and tricks on social media and [in my newsletter](/subscribe), which has over 16,000 readers.
