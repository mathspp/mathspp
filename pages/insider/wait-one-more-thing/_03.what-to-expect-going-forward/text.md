## What to expect going forward

After confirming, expect a new lesson every Monday afternoon.
Each email is a deep dive that is:

 - **clear** â€“ I use clear analogies and clear code examples to make sure you understand everything;
 - **thoughtfully educational** â€“ I won't waste your time with hype or LLM-generated content. I only write thoughtful emails with you in mind; and
 - **quirky** â€“ I'm a bit of a quirky person and my emails reflect that sometimes but you'll always learn something new.

You can reply to any issue to ask questions or suggest the next topic: I read every email I get and respond to _almost_ all emails.
(I don't respond to SPAM, for example ðŸ˜‰)
