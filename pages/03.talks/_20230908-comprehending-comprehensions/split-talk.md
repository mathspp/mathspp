In this talk I helped the audience discover the immense potential of Python's list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, set comprehensions, and generator expressions, as I presented them as an idiom that focuses on data transformations.

 - Where: [PyCon Portugal 2023](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/pycon-pt-2023/talk/FMZMGP/)
 - When: 8th of September, 2023
 - The talk was based on my book [“Comprehending Comprehensions”](/comprehending-comprehensions)
 - Slides for the talk: [static PDF][pdf-slides] (low res), [online slides][snappify-slides]

This talk complemented my tutorial on the same subject, but the talk hadn't been accepted for the original schedule.
However, I stepped in when a speaker had to cancel a few days before the conference.
