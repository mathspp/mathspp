# You DON'T know comprehensions ðŸ¤·

## EuroPython 2023

In this poster session, I make the claim that the vast majority of people don't know comprehensions well enough!
Thankfully, this is very easy to fix!

 - Where: [EuroPython 2023](http://ep2023.europython.eu/session/you-dont-know-comprehensions)
 - When: 20th of July, 2023

Dozens approached me during my poster presentation â€“ which I repeated tirelessly from noon until 3 pm because people just kept showing up â€“ and I am very proud to say that my poster (presentation) got a lot of praise.

But, most importantly, I got feedback from people that learned new things about list comprehensions thanks to my poster.
