---

In this impromptu Python tutorial, I gave a practical introduction to descriptors.

 - Where: [EuroPython 2023](http://ep2023.europython.eu/session/practical-introduction-to-descriptors)
 - When: 18th of July, 2023
 - Written version of the tutorial: [blog article][article]
 - Slide deck: [link](https://github.com/mathspp/talks/blob/main/20230718-practical_introduction_to_descriptors/slides.pdf)

This tutorial had not been scheduled in advance.
The day before, I noticed there was an empty slot in the schedule.

After talking to the organisers, we concluded it was OK for me to use that slot and so I whipped up a short, practical tutorial for descriptors.
