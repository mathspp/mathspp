In this lighthearted lightning talk I took a Python script for a tkinter calculator and continuously refactored it until the whole calculator was a single expression.
We managed to get some laughs out of this ridiculous process, while we also explored a couple of interesting Python features like conditional expressions, Boolean short-circuiting, and assignment expressions.

I was very happy with my performance and so was James, who dubbed it a [“killer lightning talk”](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamesgshields_just-finished-pycon-ireland-2023-a-huge-activity-7129793135693459457-J_xd).
