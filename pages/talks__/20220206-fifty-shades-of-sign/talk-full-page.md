## Description

The Zen of Python says “there should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it”, but what if there's a dozen obvious ways to do it?

In this talk we take a look at over a dozen implementations of a very simple function.
As we do so, we try to decide which alternative is the best and we even explore a couple of more intricate Python subtleties!

Which implementation will be the best?
