## Description

In this short talk, I will introduce all the key ideas necessary for you to finally understand comprehensions: list, dict, and set comprehensions, plus generator expressions.

I will explain the key argument in favour of list comprehensions and I will show how to turn any suitable loop into its equivalent comprehension.

By the time the talk is over, you'll be much closer to getting your black belt in comprehension-fu.
