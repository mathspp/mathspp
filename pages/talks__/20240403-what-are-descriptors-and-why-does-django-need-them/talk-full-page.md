## Description

Frameworks like Django use advanced Python features to provide devs with the magical tools they know and love.

In this live-coded talk we’ll take a look at a couple of Django snippets that use descriptors under the hood and we’ll use them as motivating examples for why Python needs descriptors.

By the end of the talk, you’ll understand how descriptors work and how they power Django behind the scenes.
