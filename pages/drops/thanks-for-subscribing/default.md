# Python drops 🐍💧

## Wait! Just one more thing...

For your safety, you have to **confirm your subscription** to the newsletter.
Without doing this, you **will not** receive your drops of Python knowledge.

## What to expect

After confirming, expect one daily email (during weekdays, Monday through Friday) at around 2pm Lisbon time.
Each email contains a tip that is:

 - **short** – You're busy and I respect that.
 - **actionable** – You'll learn things that you can put to use immediately.
 - **new** – I try my best to stay off the beaten track.

Each tip is followed by **a multiple-choice poll**.
After reading the tip, click the poll to give me feedback regarding the tip.
This helps me write more useful tips in the future!

## What to do

Right now, head over to your inbox and look for the confirmation email.
It should have 🐍💧 in the subject.
Open it and click the big “confirm” button.

(The email might have landed on your SPAM folder...)

## See you soon!
