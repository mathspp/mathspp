## What's going to happen

Expect one daily email (during weekdays) with a tip that is:

 - **short** – You're busy and I respect that.
 - **actionable** – You'll learn things that you can put to use immediately.
 - **new** – I try my best to stay off the beaten track.

Each tip is followed by **a multiple-choice poll**.
After reading the tip, click the poll to give me feedback regarding the tip.
This helps me write more useful tips in the future!
