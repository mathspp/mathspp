## I have something for you

By now, you should have received a welcome email on your inbox.
The email subject should contain üêçüíß so it's pretty easy to spot.

This email is just to welcome you to the newsletter and to give you a little something.

You see, I have already sent dozens of these tips that you didn't have access to...

But I don't want you to lose out on all of those tips!

So, I'm giving you the chance to take a peek at 5 of my best tips from the past.

All you have to do is let me know your Python level...

And I will send you tips that are appropriate for your level!

Just check the welcome e-mail and follow the instructions.
