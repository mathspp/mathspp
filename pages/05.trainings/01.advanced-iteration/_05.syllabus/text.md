## Course syllabus

 - List, dictionary, and set comprehensions.
 - Iterators vs iterables (built-in collections, collections from standard modules, `enumerate`, `zip`, and others).
 - Generator functions: definition and usage.
 - Simplification and abstraction of iteration details with generators.
 - Generator pipelines.
 - Generator expressions.
 - Custom iterables and iterators.
 - Iteration patterns and idioms with the module `itertools` from the standard library:
   - Reshaping iterables: `batched`, `chain`, `groupby`, and more.
   - Filtering iterables: `compress`, `dropwhile`, `filterfalse`, and `takewhile`.
   - Other iterables: `accumulate`, `cycle`, `starmap`, and more.
 - Type hints for generators, custom iterables, and custom iterators.

If you would like to tweak the course syllabus to your needs, [reach out to me](/contact-me?target=_blank&subject=Advanced%20iteration%20course%20syllabus%20adjustment) and we will work something out.
For example, some teams ask me to omit the section on type hints since they do not use type hints in their projects.
