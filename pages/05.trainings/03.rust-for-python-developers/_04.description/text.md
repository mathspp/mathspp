## Course description

Rust is a popular, low-level language that is famous for its speed and safety.
In the Python world, Rust has been rising in popularity as individuals and teams develop Python packages written in Rust.

Leveraging the knowledge that participants already have of Python, this course teaches how to write efficient, safe Rust code.
Participants will learn about some of the key concepts and design decisions that make Rust such a popular language, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, and they will learn how an understanding of the underlying rules enables programmers to write the safe and performant programs that Rust is known for.

By the end of this course, participants will be able to write and compile Rust programs, as well as create and package their projects with cargo, Rust's package manager.
Participants will also be in a position to start using Rust to develop Python packages, bringing the best of Python and Rust together.
