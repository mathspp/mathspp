## Course description

Python is a programming language that natively supports development in multiple paradigms.
Developers frequently make use of the object-oriented features of Python, or even some of its functional capabilities, but all projects across all business domains leverage a fundamental concept from imperative programming: iteration.

Iteration in Python goes well beyond the C-style `for` loop.
Knowing how to make an effective use of the tools that Python provides for flexible iteration is the basis for developing projects that are robust, idiomatic, and efficient.

In this course, participants will learn these tools and idioms required to use iteration appropriately, unlocking the ability to express complex business logic clearly, reduce code duplication, and write code that is both idiomatic and maintainable.
Participants will explore generators and generator pipelines, custom iterators, the iterator protocol, the powerful utilities provided by the module `itertools`, and more.

By the end of the course, participants will not only understand how iteration works under the hood, but also how to design and refactor code with iteration in mind, making them more effective Python developers in any domain.
