I help Python programmers become more efficient and improve their skills.
My students find that they learn to write code that is more readable, easily maintainable, expressive, and often even shorter and faster!

To help you and your team master Python programming, I offer on-site and remote trainings.
These can be 1-day trainings for a quick intro / refresher on a particular subject or 4-day trainings for a more complete overview of an important topic.

These trainings are designed to deepen the understanding your team has of Python, raising the ceiling of what they're able to achieve and making them more efficient programmers.

Read below for some trainings I already offer or [contact me](/about/#contacts) to discuss your specific training needs.
