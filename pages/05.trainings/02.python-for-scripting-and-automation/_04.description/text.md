## Course description

In the past, Python was often described to be “the second-best language for anything”.
While Python is now the de facto standard in some domains, the versatility and general applicability of Python remains a blessing for everyone with access to a computer.

Combining its “beginner-friendly” syntax, its vast standard library, and the 400,000+ packages available on PyPI, professionals of all domains can use Python as a tool to expedite their work.
This usually takes the form of scripts and command line interface (CLI) tools that automate and simplify all sorts of repetitive tasks.

In this course, participants will learn about the standard library modules that are commonly useful when automating workflows, as well as some popular and useful packages that allow participants to create command line interfaces (CLI) and text user interfaces (TUI).
These CLI and TUI tools are essential in making sure that the automation solutions developed are easily reusable, and participants will also learn how to package these tools so others can make use of them.

By the end of the course, participants will have working knowledge in automatic common tasks across a number of different domains.
On top of that, participants will be able to develop and maintain CLI and TUI tools that make their automation workflows more accessible and easy to use.
Finally, participants will also be able to package and distribute their tools to other developers, both internally and to the general public.
