# Pydon'ts v4

## PyCon Portugal 2022

In this Python talk, I continuously refactored a piece of code by using Python features elegantly.

 - Where: [PyCon Portugal](https://2022.pycon.pt) 2022, virtual[^1]
 - When: 24th of September, 2022
 - Video recording: [view on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ETg64K32Okc)
 - Slide deck: [link](https://github.com/mathspp/talks/blob/main/20220924_pycon_portugal_pydonts_4/slide_deck.pdf)

**Abstract**: In this talk I show what idiomatic Python code looks like and illustrate how the subjective notion of “beautiful”, or “elegant” code, can make your code objectively better, regardless of your Python skill level. We do that by visiting several vanilla Python features that people sometimes forget to learn, as they rush to importing all the shiny modules and frameworks they really want to use. In order to achieve this, we go through the learning journey of a hypothetical Pythonista that wanted to implement enumerate from scratch. We will start with a first version written by them and then refactor it incrementally through the use of Pythonic idioms and patterns.

The talk will build around a series of articles available online (at https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts), where I explore all the vanilla Python features that make Python one of the most interesting programming languages to learn.

There are no prerequisites for this talk, and both advanced users and beginners alike can benefit from it. After the talk, you will have a better understanding of several concepts such as iterables and (infinite!) lazy generators, and you will know how to use them effectively to get the job done.


[^1]: I was scheduled to give this talk in presence but I had a family emergency and couldn't attend.
Later, I recorded the talk at home and made it unofficially available online.
