What if you could program with maths..?

# Purpose

This workshop sets out to explore an alternative mathematical notation that is less
ambiguous than the traditional mathematical notation we used nowadays.
In fact, this alternative notation is so unambiguous that it evolved into a programming language.


# Content

A session consists of a brief exploration of some of APL's capabilities,
typically showcasing its affinity for mathematics and its array-oriented programming paradigm.

Depending on the background of the audience, this exploration can take several forms.
For a more maths oriented audience, we might draw the Mandelbrot set together.
For an audience that is not necessarily as fond of mathematics as I am,
we might instead see how we can justify text in APL.

If you have any questions feel free to leave them below in the comments,

# Feedback

Here's some of the things that have been said about this workshop:

 > “*I had never heard about APL and even though it was quite short,
 > it was very enlightening.
 > I will certainly research more about the language, especially
 > because it looked intuitive and "simpler" than what I expected.*”
