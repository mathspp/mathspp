title: "Your first genetic algorithm"
---

Take Darwin's ideas on the evolution of species to write
computer programs that evolve.

===

# Purpose

With this workshop I want to show people what genetic programming is
and how it can be really fun to use to solve “difficult” programming tasks.

Depending on the programming skills of the audience, the algorithm
and the example can be simpler or more complex.


# Content

In a simpler session, what we do is take silly cleaning robots like this one:

![](initial_robot.gif "A randomly generated robot trying to clean the room.")

And then borrow ideas from Darwin's theory of evolution to create better cleaning robots, like this one:

![](better_robot.gif "A better robot that is able to clean more squares.")

By the end of the workshop, the participant has finished a basic genetic algorithm that is able
to create a robot like the second one, evolving it from the first one.
