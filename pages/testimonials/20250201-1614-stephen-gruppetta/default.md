My email inbox is precious–as is everyone else's–so I don't subscribe to newsletters. But I make a very few exceptions. Rodrigo's newsletter is one of this exclusive group. And his emails are a few of the emails I actually always read.

His writing is fresh and refreshing, easy to read but packed with useful information, never boring, always insightful.

If you call yourself a Pythonista–or wish to do so one day–and you're not yet subscribed to Rodrigo's email, then, what are waiting for?!

And while you're there, get a copy of all his books. Yes, all of them.
