Rodrigo's book Comprehending Comprehensions is a well-written explanation of comprehensions and generators, set in a language very readable for beginners like myself Highly recommended for Pythonistas of every level. Rodrigo really keeps his promise of help. My experience to date: very quick replies to questions with great solutions. Besser geht's nicht! 👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟
