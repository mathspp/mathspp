The live sessions were fantastic — your teaching style makes topics approachable and engaging. I learned a lot not just from the material itself, but from watching you work through code and answer questions. The course was a lot of fun, and it gave me more confidence in my programming skills. I wasn’t even sure I qualified as ‘intermediate’ before, but now I feel confident that I am.
