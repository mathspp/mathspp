This was one of the best learning experiences I’ve had. I came away feeling like I learned WAY more about each topic than I thought I already knew, and now I really want to apply the concepts to get an even deeper understanding. The live sessions, exercises, and reference materials were all extremely useful. One of the most valuable things I learned wasn’t just specific tools, but a new way to think about Python — as a set of building blocks you can assemble to solve problems. It was absolutely worth the financial and time investment.
