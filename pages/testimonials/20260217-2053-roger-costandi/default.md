It was really a fun and very fruitful time! I had no doubts about the quality and usefulness of your course before joining, but it revealed to be really over the top. I learned more things than I thought was possible in such a limited time frame.

The sessions were very interesting, mixing fundamental knowledge with a lot of practical tips, with a little humour spread, and the exercises were spot on for applying the various notions so as to remember them instead of letting them disappear in the clouds of lost memory.

The supporting documentation is incredibly abundant and will prove very useful for future reference.

Thank you Rodrigo for hosting and animating such a great course.
