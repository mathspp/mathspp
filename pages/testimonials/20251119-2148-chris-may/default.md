As a host of a Python user group, I hope to find speakers who can speak well about a topic they care about.

Last night, Rodrigo showed he was so much more than that.

His presentation was well thought out, well paced, very funny, and very informative. People came up to me afterwards, glowing, telling me how much they learned.

He introduced topics gradually to help everyone learn along the way, and it's clear that he is a well-practiced and excellent trainer.
