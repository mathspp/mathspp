Thank you for an excellent course and for sharing your experience and practical tips. I’m especially excited to apply generators to better handle messy data and recover from errors while processing iterables. I also appreciated the deep dive into tools like uv, mypy, and publishing to PyPI — I’ve already switched from Anaconda to uv because of this course.
