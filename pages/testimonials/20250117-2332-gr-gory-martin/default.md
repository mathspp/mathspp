There is a bunch of people from Twitter whose work is really inspiring and you clearly belong to them. It's really a given to have benevolent people like you to spend time "lighting the way" for others to learn. Bismark once said "Only fools only count on their own experience while you can count on the others' one". Clearly, if you don't mind, I'll continue to see Python's world through your vision, on your shoulders. Thank you so much!
