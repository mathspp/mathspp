I attended [Rodrigo's talk at Pycon Italia](/blog/dipping-my-toes-in-metaprogramming), and that had to be the one of the best talks of the conference.
I loved every bit of it and how he explained the depths of the concept was something I also liked very much.
It was so good and took some notes for myself haha!
