What I take from my experience is that Rodrigo tries – and succeeds – in explaining concepts in the simplest way possible, which makes learning much easier. Additionally, he is interactive with the students and always available to provide exercises and any other information we may need. I really enjoyed my experience, and I am sure that many others will also have an excellent learning experience with Rodrigo.
