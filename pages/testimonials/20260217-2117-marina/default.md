The live sessions were very helpful, and I’m especially excited to apply decorators. I come from a data science background without a formal computer science education, and this course helped me better understand how to write clearer, more structured code and follow functional programming principles. It challenged me to rethink how I approach coding and gave me a better foundation to improve.
