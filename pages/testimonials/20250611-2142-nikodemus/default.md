I really enjoy the [Mathspp insider newsletter](/insider).
The newsletter offers clear and practical Python code examples that help explain a wide range of topics, from basic concepts to more advanced techniques.
I appreciate how the content is often self-contained while also including references to related blog posts for further reading.
Itâ€™s a good resource for improving Python skills.
