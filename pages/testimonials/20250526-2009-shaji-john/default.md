Your list comprehensions book is really good.
I liked the way you make the reader think about what the code they have been writing and how some things are better as list comprehensions.
I also liked how you gradually increase the difficulty from a simple to a complex scenario.

It's also not just about list comprehensions.
You show many tips and tricks to write better code.

I am really grateful to you.
