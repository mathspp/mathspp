I learned more in one week than I could have learned in multiple weeks teaching myself. Decorators and generators were completely new to me, and I now see how powerful they are. The interactive live sessions were incredibly effective — being able to ask questions and get them resolved in real time made a huge difference. This was well worth the time and energy.
