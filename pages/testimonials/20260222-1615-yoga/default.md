This cohort was exactly at the right level for me. The live sessions were engaging, and I learned a lot from you and the other people on the call. Decorators and generators were especially exciting, and I’m looking forward to applying them in my own work.

We’re really fortunate to have you put on these sessions — it’s not always easy to find mentors who can communicate difficult things simply, or who can truly meet you where you are. This course struck that balance perfectly. I really enjoyed attending and came away with a lot to solidify and apply.
