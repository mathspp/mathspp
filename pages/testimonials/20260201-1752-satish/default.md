I attended Rodrigo's Intermediate Python course last week and had the most excellent time.
Rodrigo is articulate, knowledgeable and engaging, and the live sessions were a lot of fun.
The roughly 50:50 split of theory and exercises meant there was plenty of time to consolidate learning.
And there're a lot more exercises to continue the learning experience beyond the week.
I strongly recommend Rodrigo and this course to anyone wanting to improve their Python skills.
