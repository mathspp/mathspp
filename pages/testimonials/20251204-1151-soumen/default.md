I attended Rodrigo's [Intermediate Python course](/courses/intermediate-python-course).
The course definitely showcases the depth of knowledge Rodrigo has.
For me the biggest takeaway, it helped me to approach and solve problems in a more concise and pythonic way, which was a big positive in the coding interviews.
