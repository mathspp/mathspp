The course was really interesting and fun. The live sessions were definitely the best way to learn, and the material felt well balanced — neither massive nor tedious. I’m leaving with the feeling of wanting more and going deeper into the topics. Having access to all the references and exercises will give me plenty of time to digest everything properly.
