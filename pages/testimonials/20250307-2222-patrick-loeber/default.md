Rodrigo's ability to provide in-depth explanations for difficult problems is truly unique.
It is rare to find good explanations that look beyond the basics, so if you want to deepen your understanding of various programming problems, this is the perfect opportunity!
And I believe Rodrigo is the perfect mentor for this bootcamp.
