A text about coding has to be technical, of course, but still it's nice if it is not dry. Also, it's nice if somebody is willing to share not just his knowledge but even ideas that came to him during his work. Both I've found at the Rodrigo's "corner of the Internet", and I'm thankful for that.
Nice work, and nice young person!
