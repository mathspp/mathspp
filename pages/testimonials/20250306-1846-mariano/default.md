I discovered your blog a couple of months ago and little by little, day by day, I read all the posts you put up. I'm up to date now.
I like your way of writing and explaining Python concepts, with clear examples and code visualizations.
I'm an industrial programmer. I dedicate myself to PLC and SCADA programming mainly. I don't have many opportunities to use Python, but I'm a fan and I try to make small scripts every now and then to automate some jobs.
Thank you again for your dedication to creating useful content.
Muchas gracias por todo.
