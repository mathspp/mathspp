I discovered Rodrigo’s Python drops as I was exploring new features of Python 3.14.0 when it was in beta testing. I was trying to understand the new Placeholder class and found his drop about not only that topic but how it applies to Partial.

His explanation was clear, concise and left me understanding a wonderful new Python feature. I’m a highly satisfied Python drops reader.
