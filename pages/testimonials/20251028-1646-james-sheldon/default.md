I discovered Rodrigo’s Python drops as I was exploring new features of Python 3.14.0 when it was in beta testing.
I was trying to understand the new `Placeholder` class and found his drop about not only that topic but how it applies to `partial`.

His explanation was clear, concise and left me understanding a wonderful new Python feature.
I’m a highly satisfied Python drops reader.
