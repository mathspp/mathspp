Python Problem-Solving Bootcamp has a wonderful combination.
Advent of Code puzzles are designed to make you think carefully and dig deeper into your programming knowledge. Rodrigo's instructions and mentorship will help hone your own style of coding.
I believe Rodrigo is well suited for this bootcamp, given his inquisitiveness and attention to details.
Whether it is building Neural Networks from scratch, learning the minimax algorithm or exploring a new concept (ex: Structural pattern matching), I've found his curiosity, enthusiasm and presentation skills to be top-notch.
