Reading the newsletter is a nice way to get new ideas or insights into features I've never/rarely seen before.
Moreover, everything is explained clearly and concise enough, so it's easy to read basically anywhere: the daily bus commute, a short car ride, or even when class gets a bit boring :)
Thank you!
