I have some hobbies that help me keep my good mood and interest in life. Two of these hobbies are Python and English. What do I like about Rodrigo? He can pick very interesting examples and tasks for explaining every topic, and these tasks are short. While looking for answers, you cannot get tired and all mechanisms become obvious. Additionally, he often adds different external modules and lets us learn new variants of use. If you want to take it a step further, you can visit his website https://mathspp.gumroad.com. What I enjoy the most is his funny English style. I understand that English is not his native language, but watching him makes me want to talk (and write) like him (and learn more about Python and English 😉👍).
