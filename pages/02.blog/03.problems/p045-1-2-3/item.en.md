Figure out the number I'm thinking of with a single question!

# Problem statement

I'm thinking of a number amongst 1, 2, and 3.
You are allowed to ask me a single question, to which I will truthfully answer
with “yes”, “no”, or “I don't know”.

How can you find out the number I picked?

!!! Give it some thought!

# Solution

**Lots** of people sent in their solutions and I was very pleased
with the amount of different solutions people came up with!
Hence, the solution I present here is not the _only one_,
but it's one I find very elegant.

The question you will ask me is

 > “If I pick one of the other two numbers, is yours larger?”

If I picked 3, then I know 3 is larger than any of the two other numbers (1 and 2).
Therefore, I answer “Yes.”.

If I picked 1, then I know 1 is smaller than any of the two other numbers (2 and 3).
Therefore, I answer “No.”.

If I picked 2, then I have no idea if you got 1 or 3,
and that implies I need to reply “I don't know.”.

That's a pretty elegant solution, isn't it?
