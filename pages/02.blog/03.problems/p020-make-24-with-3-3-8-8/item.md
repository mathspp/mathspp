title: 'Problem #020 - make 24 with 3 3 8 8'
---

Today we are visiting a specific instance of a well-known _basic_ mathematics game, the [24 Game]. The "24 Game" is usually played with younger students because it helps them develop skills related to the basic arithmetic operations.

## Problem statement

The "24 Game" is usually played with four different numbers from $1$ to $9$, for example drawn randomly out of a small deck with those numbers. For this blog post, you can forget about all that, I picked very specific numbers for you.

Using the four numbers $3$, $3$, $8$ and $8$ and the four arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, you have to make an expression that evaluates to $24$. The rules are simple:

 - each number must be used exactly once;
 - operations can be used any number of times (even zero times);
 - the precedence of operations can be changed by the use of $()$;
 - numbers cannot be used by positioning them in a special way, e.g. you can't make $33$ by joining the two $3$s and you can't make $27$ by writing $3^3$.

I am not giving you a puzzle with a cheap trick involved. This is pure arithmetic.

An example valid expression would be $(3+3)\times (8+8)$ except this is not the solution because it gives $96$ instead of $24$.

!!! Give it some thought, maybe take out a piece of paper and a pencil.

I heard of this from the same friend who told me about the ["Fold the alphabet"][fold the alphabet] problem.


### Hint

Do _not_ read the hint if you haven't spent some time thinking about the problem yet!

!!!! The intermediate steps do _not_ have to evaluate to integer numbers.


## Solution

There really is no point in sugar coating this for you, the solution is the expression $8 \div (3 - 8\div 3)$. Quite ingenious, isn't it?
