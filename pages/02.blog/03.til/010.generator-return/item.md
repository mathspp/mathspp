Today I learned that Python generators can return a value.

# Generators

Generators are interesting Python objects that produce a series of values,
but one by one.
In a way, they can be thought of as stateful functions.
(That is, functions with state.)

What I learned is that generators can also return something.
Here is the tweet that prompted this discovery:

# Returning from a generator

When you use a `return` inside a generator,
the generator will have that returned information in its `StopIteration`
exception when it's done:

```py
>>> def f():
...     yield 10
...     return 20
...
>>> gen = f()
>>> next(gen)
10
>>> next(gen)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration: 20
```

If you want to get access to that value, you just need to catch the exception:

```py
>>> gen = f(); next(gen);
10
>>> try:
...     next(gen)
... except StopIteration as e:
...     val = e.value
...
>>> val
20
```

That's it for now! [Stay tuned][subscribe] and I'll see you around!
