Let's prove that, if a set has size $n$, then that same set has exactly $2^n$ subsets.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

![|S| = n implies that |P(S)| = 2^n](subsets.webp?crop=0,60,532,120)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter proof:<br>Take a set of size n. For any of its subsets, we can label items with 0/1 depending on whether or not the item is in the subset or not, and to any such labelling corresponds a single subset. There are 2^n such labellings, hence 2^n subsets.<a href="https://t.co/5uxKAi7D9T">https://t.co/5uxKAi7D9T</a></p>&mdash; Mathspp (@mathsppblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathsppblog/status/1291501878111502338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

Do you have an idea for a twitter proof? Let me know in the comments below!
