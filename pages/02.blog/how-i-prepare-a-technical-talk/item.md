# How I prepare a technical talk

I have a lot of fun giving talks at conferences.
I am not the best speaker ever and I am far from being a prestiged speaker.
However, I have had enough positive feedback from enough talks to claim with some confidence that I am a decent speaker.

The article will be split into five sections outlining my thoughts on:

 1. [slide design](#slide-design);
 2. [audience engagement](#audience-engagement);
 3. [talk delivery](#talk-delivery);
 4. [how to practice](#how-to-practice); and
 5. [managing Q&A](#managing-qa).

I will also include some notes on how I personally [prepare the content for my talks](#content-preparation) and I will close this article with a **very important note** regarding the fact that, obviously, [all of this is subjective](#all-of-this-is-subjective).


## Slide design

Most presenters use a slide deck as the medium for the content of their presentation.
Your audience will spend a great deal of time looking at your slide deck, so it is important that your slide deck is a tool that **helps** you deliver your excellent technical talk, and not something that hinders your performance.

When creating my slide deck I try to follow these guidelines:

 - _Keep text to a minimum_: no walls of text. No long paragraphs. No huge sentences. Everyone says this and yet everyone disrespects this. Please, keep text to a minimum.
 - _Bullet points only_: to help with the above, I tend to include text in the form of basic, short bullet points.
 - _Large font size_: use a huge font size. No, it won't be too big. Also, if the font size is huge you can't fit a lot of text in the slide. That's a bonus.
 - _Your audience either listes or reads_: your audience can't multitask. If they are looking at your slides, reading, they are **not** listening to you.
 - _If it's in your slide, they will read it_: or try to.
 **Everything** that shows up on your slides will distract your audience. If it's in a small font, you'll lose time while the audience tries really hard to read what you included in a small font size.
 - _No animations_: or only very simple ones. If things move a lot, you'll distract your audience and if you distract them it will be hard to get their attention back.


## Audience engagement

If your audience isn't engaged, they won't listen to you.
That's it.
And there's no point in giving a talk if no one is paying attention.

 - _Actively engage your audience_: make an effort to interact with your audience. Small interactions pay off greatly.
 - _Shows of hands_: ask questions that can be answered with a show of hands. The physical movement keeps the audience awake.
 - _Basic questions_: you can ask really simple questions to increase the chance of getting an answer from the answer.
 - _Questions to which you know the answer_: this means you get to interact with the audience without losing control of the narrative, which makes it unlikely for your talk to derail because of an interaction with the audience.


## Talk delivery

The way you deliver your talk can make or break a great talk.
It is important to know what you are talking about and your talk should be built around great content.
But having great content doesn't automatically mean your talk will be great.

 - _Your talk doesn't need to be a circus_: look for small things you can do to improve your delivery but don't go with over-the-top theatrics.
 - _Use humour_: humour is great, even if you are not a comedian. A joke here and there is a great addition to a talk.
 - _Live coding_: everyone I listen to recommends against live coding. I love doing live coding, but be aware that it is a high-risk/high-reward kind of thing. Make sure you practice a lot and have a backup plan in case **anything** fails. Tip: Internet **can** fail at a tech conference. I've seen it.
 - _20% of the show-off gets 80% of the results_: again, minimal flair can often achieve great results. You just want to make sure your talk is not super dry.
 - _Keep your voice in check_: manage your rhythm and your tone. Don't go so fast no one understands what you are saying. Hit more than one note with your voice.
 - _Have fun_: if you are having fun, you will pass that on to your audience. If you are genuinely enjoying your time on stage, it really does increase the chance that your audience will enjoy your talk.


## How to practice

Have you ever been in a talk where the speaker is constantly surprised by their own slides?
Don't be that person.
Make sure you practice your talk so you can give your whole presentation smoothly.

 - _Practice repeatedly_: go over your talk more than once. Everyone knows practice makes perfect and when it comes to giving talks, it shows.
 - _Record yourself giving the talk_: when you're at a point where you feel comfortable with your delivery, record yourself and watch it. Speed it up if you want, but watch it and critique yourself. Watching yourself will give you a more faithful representation of what the audience will get and you will realise that you don't sound as good as when you're just inside your head.
 - _Practice the talk standing up_: simulate the actual experience as closely as possible. You won't be sitting down when you give your talk, so why are you practicing sitting down?
 - _Don't script your talk word for word_: if you do, you'll (try) to memorise the exact script and if you forget a word or sentence, you will get stuck.
 - _Learn the key points and their order_: instead of scripting your talk fully, make sure you know the overall key points of your talk and the order in which you are supposed to go through them. When practicing your talk, go through those key points but use different wordings and sentences. Experiment with different examples.
 - _Keep speaker notes in your slides or in a printout_: it's not cheating, it's preparation. Your speaker notes shouldn't be the full script of your talk. They should contain the key points of each section or slide so you can quickly check if you're forgetting something. It's ok to have speaker notes and to check them but it is not ok to spend 
 - _Practice the timing_: time yourself and check the time as you go through the main sections of your talk to get accustomed to the ideal timing. This will make it easier to keep track of your rhythm when you're doing the actual presentation.

I find that I tend to speed up a bit when giving the actual talk, either because I talk faster than when I practiced or because I forget to mention one thing or another in some sections.
Provided I practiced the timing well enough I will be able to spend more time in some other section of the talk to make up for that.


## Managing Q&A

The Q&A section of your talk doesn't have to be daunting and there are some great tips to consider for when you're doing live Q&A at the end of your talk:

 - _Be comfortable with not knowing_: it's ok not to have all the answers. Intelligent people say they don't know; they don't make up answers. If someone asks a question you don't have an answer for, say you don't know and offer to follow-up after the talk.
 - _Suggest private conversation in complex/off-topic Q&A_: avoid derailing the Q&A. If someone starts going off-topic or asking really complex, niche, or contrived, questions, offer to follow-up after the talk, so that other members of the audience have the opportunity to ask their questions.
 - _Douchebag questions/remarks_: if someone walks up to the microphone and makes a douchebag remark or asks a douchebag question, the audience will also understand it's a douchebag remark/question. It's ok to politely dismiss those and your audience won't blame you for it.


## Content preparation

When I'm preparing a talk I always start with the content.
I follow more or less the same workflow every time but I don't have a list of guidelines or suggestions.
Instead, I will just share what I do.

After picking a topic for my talk the first thing I do is spend **a lot** of time thinking about it.
When walking on the street.
When taking public transportation.
On the toilet.
In queues.
I just fry brain cells thinking about that topic.
Examples related to the topic.
Analogies.
Related concepts or topics.
Anything and everything that's around the topic.
This typically yields a lot of different things I could include in my talk, but at this point all I have is a big blob of ideas.

After I have a big blob of ideas, I sit down to sort them.
I try to order some of the ideas in a reasonable way that leads the audience to my desired conclusion.
In this step I do not necessarily use all of the things I thought about in the previous step.

After I have the rough order in which I want to cover the main ideas/examples/topics of my talk, I write about them.
I don't script my talks, but I typically write a blog article that I use as a reference for my talk.
As I'm writing the article, I get to test if the ideas I selected and the order I laid them out makes sense.
As I'm writing the article, I get to check if the examples are good and if the analogies make sense.

I only start working on my slides after writing the blog post.


## All of this is subjective

I've shared with you most of the things I think about when I prepare a talk.
I try to follow the things I jotted down here.
Some of them, I manage to follow quite nicely.
Some others are still things I aspire to be able to do well in the future.

It is important to understand that most of these guidelines are quite subjective.
These guidelines work well for me and you can try them out for yourself, but they won't necessarily work for you.
I know good speakers who follow similar guidelines and I know good speakers who do the complete opposite of some of the things I say here.
You can experiment and draw inspiration from the workflows of others, but in the end you have to find what works for you.

I appreciate you taking the time to go through this article.
I'd be interested in hearing about your personal experience as a speaker, so please leave a comment below or [drop me a line](/contact-me) to share your own recommendations and your workflow.
