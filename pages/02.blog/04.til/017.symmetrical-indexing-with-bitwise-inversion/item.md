Today I learned about the symmetry in indexing from the beginning and end of a list with the bitwise invert operator.

## Negative indexing

As you might be aware of, Python allows indexing with negative indices:

```py
>>> s = "Hello, there!"
>>> s[-1]
'!'
```

In case this is new to you, you can check out [this Pydon't on the subject][pydont-negative-indexing].

One thing to note is that the index for the `n`th element is `n - 1`,
but the index for the `n`th element from the end is `-n`.
This is just ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù, but it is kind of a bummer because it is very asymmetrical:

```py
>>> seq = "ABCDCBA"
>>> seq[0], seq[-1]     # 0 and -1
('A', 'A')
>>> seq[1], seq[-2]     # 1 and -2
('B', 'B')
>>> seq[2], seq[-3]     # 2 and -3
('C', 'C')
>>> seq[3], seq[-4]     # 3 and -4
('D', 'D')
```

By looking at the correspondences above,
we can see that the positive index `n` pairs up with the index `-n - 1`.


## Bitwise invert

Python has a couple of bitwise operations, one of them being bitwise invert `~`.
Bitwise invert `~n` is defined as `-(n+1)`:

```py
>>> n = 38
>>> ~n
-39
>>> -(n+1)
-39
>>> n = -73
>>> ~n
72
>>> -(n+1)
72
```

Now, maybe you can see where I'm going with this, but `-(n+1)` simplifies to `-n - 1`.


## Symmetrical indexing with bitwise inversion

If we put these two pieces of knowledge together,
we can see how we can use bitwise inversion `~` to index symmetrically from the beginning
_and_ end of a sequence, like a string or a list:

```py
>>> seq = "abccba"
>>> seq[1], seq[~1]
('b', 'b')
>>> for i in range(len(seq) // 2):
...     print(seq[i], seq[~i])
...
a a
b b
c c
```

Doesn't this look beautiful?

I feel like this is one of those things that you really won't use that often,
but there will come a time in your life when you'll want to exploit this symmetry!
And, you either remember what you just learned about `~`, or you'll be writing the uglier version with subtractions:

```py
>>> seq = "abccba"
>>> seq[1], seq[~1]
('b', 'b')
>>> for i in range(len(seq) // 2):
...     print(seq[i], seq[-i - 1])
...
a a
b b
c c
```

Thanks a lot to Tushar Sadhwani from bringing this to my attention:
