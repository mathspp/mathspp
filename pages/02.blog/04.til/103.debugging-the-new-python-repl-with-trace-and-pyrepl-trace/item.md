Today I learned how to debug the new Python REPL with `_pyrepl.trace` and the environment variable `PYREPL_TRACE`.

# Debugging the new Python REPL with `trace` and `PYREPL_TRACE`

As of Python 3.13, the Python REPL is written _in Python_.
This means that if you are debugging the REPL and add a call to `print` in the code for the REPL, and then run the REPL, the debugging prints will show up in the REPL, in the middle of the thing you are trying to debug.
This can get quite confusing.

To help alleviate this issue, the REPL includes a short submodule `trace` that implements the function `trace`, which can be used for debugging.
It is similar to the function `print`, but instead of writing to the console it will write to a file.

The environment variable `PYREPL_TRACE` can then be used to set the path to the file to where `trace.trace` writes.
In practice, what I do (thanks, ≈Åukasz) is I have two terminals next to each other, run `tail -f PATH_TO_FILE` in one, and run `PYREPL_TRACE=PATH_TO_FILE python` in the other, and this opens the REPL and prints the tracing live to my second terminal window.

If you have Python 3.13 installed, you can try this out for yourself:
