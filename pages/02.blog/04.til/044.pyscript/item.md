## Run Python in Your HTML

Today I learned about [PyScript], a tool that lets you run Python from within your HTML!

I got so excited when I found out about this tool
(which was presented to the world today, if I am not mistaken!)
that I had to give it a try right away!

For example, you opened this page, it loaded, and then it inserted a timestamp here: <span id="py-script-target"></span>

(If the timestamp doesn't show right away, wait a couple of seconds.
If it still doesn't show, take into account that the PyScript version I am using here has only been tested on Chrome.)

This timestamp, which corresponds roughly to when the page finished loading,
was put there by Python.
I just had to write some code in the HTML of this page:

```html
<py-script>
import datetime

output = Element("py-script-target")
now = format(datetime.datetime.now(), "%H:%M, %A, %d %B %Y.")
output.write(now)
</py-script>
```

The `output = Element("py-script-target")` assigns a `<span>` tag I have in the source of the page to the variable `output`.
Then, I use standard Python to format the current date (`datetime.datetime.now()`) into a format I like.
Finally, I write that string to the `<span>` element from before!

I am very excited to see what people build with this tool!
Just bear in mind that it is still in its early stages of development.

By the way, I found out about PyScript from a tweet:
