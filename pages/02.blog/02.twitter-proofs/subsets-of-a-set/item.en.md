Let's prove that, if a set has size $n$, then that same set has exactly $2^n$ subsets.

===

![|S| = n implies that |P(S)| = 2^n](subsets.png?cropResize=400,75)

### Twitter proof

Take a set of size $n$. For any of its subsets, we can label items with $0$/$1$ depending on whether or not the item is in the subset or not, and to any such labelling corresponds a single subset. There are $2^n$ such labellings, hence $2^n$ subsets.
