Dip your toes in metaprogramming and learn about `__init__`'s big brother, the dunder method `__new__`.

===


This is the written version of [my PyCon Italy 2025 talk](https://2025.pycon.it/en/event/dipping-my-toes-in-metaprogramming), which serves as a trial run for myself and as supporting material for folks who attended the talk, or who couldn't attend but are interested in reading about it.

## Cold opening

```pycon
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> Path(".")
PosixPath('.')
>>> type(Path(".")) == Path
False
```

Are you comfortable with the short REPL session from above?
Don't you think it's weird you try to create an instance of the class `Path` but instead you get an instance of the class `PosixPath`?
I mean, in your computer you might even get something different: an instance of the class `WindowsPath`.

Isn't it funky how the class that we get depends on your context?
In this particular case, on your operating system?


## Outline for this talk

I was using the module `pathlib` one day and I thought that this was weird, so today I will show you how this works.
Sadly for you, but thankfully for me, this is not going to be a hardcore metaprogramming talk.
After all, it is called ‚Äú_Dipping_ my toes in metaprogramming‚Äù, not ‚ÄúDrowing in metaprogramming‚Äù.
What this talk is, is an introduction to a very useful metaprogramming tool, that sits right on the fence between crazy, esoteric metaprogramming and general Python knowledge that is likely to help you out sooner or later.

The plan for this talk is to

 1. talk a little bit about parity of integers, in an attempt to show you a similar pattern that is slightly simpler;
 2. go back to talking about paths and the behaviour that they exhibit when instantiated;
 3. talk a little bit about immutability and subclassing immutable types; and
 4. we'll end with some time for Q|A, where you'll be able to ask questions or we'll sit together in awkward silence.


## Parity

To get things rolling, we will start off by trying to emulate the instantiating pattern exhibited by `Path`, but with different classes.
We will create a class `Number`, that takes integers, and that produces one of its subclasses:

 - `OddNumber`, if the integer was odd; or
 - `EvenNumber`, if the integer was even.

So, we want to build a hierarchy that looks like this:

```py
class Number:
    ...

class EvenNumber(Number): ...
class OddNumber(Number): ...
```

And the point is that, when you instantiate the class `Number`, you get an instance of `EvenNumber` or `OddNumber`, depending on the parity of the argument:

```py
print(type(Number(2)))  # <class '__main__.EvenNumber'>
```

Now, when trying to solve this problem, you might start by writing this code:

```py
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value):
        ...

class EvenNumber(Number): ...
class OddNumber(Number): ...
```

And now you're thinking ‚ÄúWhat the hell do I write in `Number.__init__`?‚Äù.
But, the truth is...
Inside `Number.__init__` it's already too late for whatever you need to do!
The argument `self` is already a reference to an object whose type is `Number` and you can't ‚Äúhot-swap‚Äù the type of an object during program execution![^1]

[^1]: I mean, maybe you can..? Python is a very dynamic language, so there may be some super dark wizardry that allows you to do this? In other words, I can't prove that it is absolutely impossible. But if it's possible, it's much more complicated than what we're about to do either way! ü§£

What's the solution, then..?

Well, one thing I like about Python is how it is so consistent in defining dunder methods that customise the whole language and the interactions with the syntax, and it just so happens that the solution to this problem lies in another dunder method!

The dunder method `__init__` has the purpose of _initialising_ your object, which for the purposes of this talk I want to refer to as ‚Äúcustomising‚Äù.
The dunder method `__init__` customises your object, performs any required setup, etc.
This implies that the object is already there to begin with.

But `__init__` has a big brother!
The dunder method `__new__` is the method that is responsible for bringing objects into existence!
That's the dunder method we need to implement.
We can go ahead and write its signature:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(...):
        ...
```

And immediately we face a challenge?
What are the parameters of `__new__`?

Since, when we run `__new__`, the instance hasn't been created yet, there's no way the first argument is `self`.
That's nonsensical.
In fact, the first parameter is `cls`, the class we are trying to create an instance of:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, ...)
        ...
```

Next, whatever arguments you pass when creating your instance also get passed to `__new__`.
In other words, if you want to be able to write something like `Number(3)`, then `__new__` needs to accept that value:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        ...

print(Number(3))
```

Finally, when I'm working with dunder methods I don't understand, I always like to add calls to the function `print`.
The whole thing with dunder methods is that they're called by Python without you having to call them, so it helps to have prints to see when your dunder methods are running:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        print("Number.__new__")

print(Number(3))
```

This code is already runnable, although it may produce results that you find unexpected:

```txt
Number.__new__
None
```

We can see that the dunder method `__new__` ran when we instantiated `Number`, but then when we print `Number(3)`, we see `None`...

And that is because `__new__` is supposed to return _something_!
What's that _something_?
It could be **anything**!

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        print("Number.__new__")
        return 73

print(Number(3))
```

Running this code, you get a 73:

```txt
Number.__new__
73
```

`__new__` can return anything you want, but typically you want it to return an instance of the class you are trying to instantiate.
Remember?
That's the whole point.
Great.
But how?

When you instantiate a class, like with `Number(3)`, you want to create a new instance.
So, Python calls `Number.__new__`.
Now, inside `Number.__new__`, you need to create a new instance!
This feels like the chicken-and-egg problem:
you need `__new__` to create the new instance, but somehow you need to create the new instance inside `__new__`.

The solution?
Pass the responsibility to someone else through `super()`:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        print("Number.__new__")
        return super().__new__(cls)

print(Number(3))
```

You call the method `__new__` on the superclass, but you pass in the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù class to make sure the new object is created with the correct type.
If you run this code now, you see that you get an instance of the class `Number`, which is what you wanted all along:

```txt
Number.__new__
<__main__.Number object at 0x10027a900>
```

Now, there is another interesting thing to consider, here.
That is the fact that you have a lot of flexibility with respect to what goes inside `super().__new__(...)`.
Take a look at this short REPL interaction:

```pycon
>>> class C: ...
...
>>> object.__new__(C)
<__main__.C object at 0x102bb46e0>
```

Note how I created a class `C`, asked `object` to create a new object of type `C`, and `object` just abided by my wishes.
In case it wasn't clear, what this is showing is that the class `cls` you pass into `super().__new__` actually determines the type you get back.

Therefore, going back to the problem of getting an instance of `EvenNumber` or `OddNumber` boils down to swapping `cls` inside `Number.__new__` depending on the parity of the argument:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        if cls is Number:
            cls = OddNumber if value % 2 else EvenNumber
        return super().__new__(cls)

class OddNumber(Number): ...
class EvenNumber(Number): ...

print(Number(3))
```

Running this code, you finally get an instance of `OddNumber` when you instantiate `Number`:

```txt
<__main__.OddNumber object at 0x1009a6900>
```

Now, what if someone that's either crazy or very distracted tries to do something like `OddNumber(42)`?
If you do so, you get a mismatch between the class name and the parity of the value, so you have to protect yourself against that.

Again, `OddNumber.__init__` feels semantically too late because at that point you already created the instance of `OddNumber`, so you can do it inside `OddNumber.__new__`:

```py
class Number:
    def __new__(cls, value):
        if cls is Number:
            cls = OddNumber if value % 2 else EvenNumber
        return super().__new__(cls)

class OddNumber(Number):
    def __new__(cls, value):
        if not value % 2:
            raise ValueError("Go drunk, you're home! üçª")

class EvenNumber(Number): ...

print(OddNumber(42))
```

Now, if you try to create an instance of `OddNumber` with an even argument, you get an exception:

```txt
# ...
ValueError: Go drunk, you're home! üçª
```

At this point, you can stand back and rejoice, since you're already implemented the instantiation pattern that `pathlib.Path` implements!
In fact, you can quickly mock it up following the same structure as for `Number` / `OddNumber` / `EvenNumber`.


## Paths

Since I can't switch operating systems in the middle of the talk, we'll pretend that the global variable `_OS` controls the operating system I'm running on:

```py
_OS = "Windows"

class Path:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls is Path:
            cls = WindowsPath if _OS == "Windows" else PosixPath
        return super().__new__(cls)

class WindowsPath(Path):
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if _OS != "Windows":
            raise RuntimeException("Nope.")

class PosixPath(Path):
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if _OS == "Windows":
            raise RuntimeException("Nope.")
```

With this code, you can already create the correct instances of your paths:

```py
# ...

_OS = "Windows"
print(type(Path(".")))  # <class '__main__.WindowsPath'>
```

If you swap the operating system, you get instances of the other type of path:

```py
# ...

_OS = "Linux"
print(type(Path(".")))  # <class '__main__.PosixPath'>
```

And this is exactly the code that the standard library module `pathlib` implements!
The code shown below is copied verbatim from Python 3.14's branch:

```py
class Path(PurePath):
    # ...
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls is Path:
            cls = WindowsPath if os.name == 'nt' else PosixPath
        return object.__new__(cls)
    # ...

# ...

class PosixPath(Path, PurePosixPath):
    # ...
    if os.name == 'nt':
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            raise UnsupportedOperation(
                f"cannot instantiate {cls.__name__!r} on your system")

class WindowsPath(Path, PureWindowsPath):
    # ...
    if os.name != 'nt':
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            raise UnsupportedOperation(
                f"cannot instantiate {cls.__name__!r} on your system")
```

Ok, I lied.
It isn't exactly the same, for two reasons.
First, the module `pathlib` swaps the order of the definition of `__new__` and the conditional check, but that's not very important.

Second, the three classes in `pathlib` inherit from other classes, and that touches on something that we didn't talk about yet.
And that is the interaction between `__new__` and `__init__`!

When you instantiate a class `MyClass`, Python will try to call `MyClass.__new__`.
If it's not there, it goes up the class hierarchy looking for a `__new__`.
(Eventually, it'll find one in `object.__new__`.)

After finding a `__new__`, Python calls it and looks at the return value.
If the return value `obj` is an instance of `MyClass`, then Python will try to call `obj.__init__`.

As a diagram, if `MyClass.__new__` exists, the flow looks like this:

![Diagram with code snippets and arrows that explain the data model when creating an instance. Trying to create an instance of MyClass triggers the method MyClass.__new__ that will return some object called obj. If obj is an instance of the class MyClass, then obj.__init__ is called with the same arguments as MyClass.__new__ was called. If obj is not an instance of the class MyClass, then we're done.](_diagram_new.webp "Flow of instantiation calls.")

In reality, Python will try to call a dunder method `__new__` with `cls` set to `MyClass`, and it will look up the hierarchy if necessary:

![Diagram with code snippets and arrows that explain the data model when creating an instance and how the hierarchy of the class MyClass plays a role in it. Trying to create an instance of MyClass triggers the method MyClass.__new__. If that method doesn't exist, Python tries MySuperClass.__new__, assuming MyClass inherits from MySuperClass. If that doesn't exist, Python keeps going up the hierarchy until it eventually reaches the top superclass, object. The first __new__ that is found will return some object called obj. If obj is an instance of the class MyClass, then obj.__init__ is called with the same arguments as MyClass.__new__ was called. If obj is not an instance of the class MyClass, then we're done.](_diagram_super.webp "The hierarchy might be traversed looking for a dunder method `__new__`")


## Immutability

Now that you've seen the dunder method `__new__` being used twice, I will show you a different application of it.
As it turns out, if you want to subclass an immutable type, you need to use `__new__`.

The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to understand.
Just consider the following REPL session:

```pycon
>>> my_list = [42, 73, 0, 16, 10]
>>> print(id(my_list))
4376165376
>>> my_list.__init__(range(3))
>>> print(id(my_list))
4376165376
>>> print(my_list)
[0, 1, 2]
```

As the example shows, by calling `__init__` on a list after creating it I'm able to mutate the values of the list.
However, it's important to note that I am mutating the list and not creating a new one, as shown by the fact that the id of the list is preserved.

On the other hand, if I'm working with an immutable type, then the dunder method `__init__` won't do anything.
If it did, then the type wouldn't be immutable in the first place:

```pycon
>>> f = float(3.14)
>>> f.__init__(0.5)
>>> f
3.14
```

With that out of the way, I just want to take a moment to appreciate how annoying floats are:

```py
print((1 / 729) * 729 == 1)
# False
```

Now that we're equipped with a shiny new hammer, let's fix this!
We'll implement a class `TolerantFloat` that performs equality comparisons with a relative error tolerance.
Since I want the class `TolerantFloat` to be a subclass of `float`, so that all other behaviour is inherited, I need to implement the dunder method `__new__`:

```py
class TolerantFloat(float):
    def __new__(cls, value, rel_tol):
        return super().__new__(cls, value)

    def __init__(self, value, rel_tol):
        self.rel_tol = rel_tol
```

To finish this off, I need to implement the dunder method `__eq__` using the relative error tolerance.
It's beside the point of this talk, but I will implement it for the sake of completeness and so that we can test it:

```py
import math

class TolerantFloat(float):
    def __new__(cls, value, rel_tol):
        return super().__new__(cls, value)

    def __init__(self, value, rel_tol):
        self.rel_tol = rel_tol

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int | float | TolerantFloat):
            return math.isclose(self, other, rel_tol=self.rel_tol)
        return NotImplemented

tf = TolerantFloat(3.14, 0.01)
print(tf == math.pi)  # True
```

Subclassing immutable types is a good example use-case for the dunder method `__new__`.


## Conclusion

In this talk you've been exposed to the dunder method `__new__`.
You've seen how it works and a couple of code examples making use of the dunder method `__new__`.
However, metaclasses were nowhere to be found...

If you ever need metaclasses, you will find that there is a huge change you'll be using the dunder method `__new__`.
When that time comes, you will remember me and thank me for having taught you how `__new__` works, because learning about `__new__` while grappling with metaclasses isn't fun for anyone.

As a quick recap, this talk tried to teach you that `__new__`:

 - brings class instances into existence;
 - returns whatever you want;
 - determines whether `__init__` runs or not; and
 - is usable for dynamic instantiation patterns.

As a side effect, I only learned these things and I only gave this talk because I was using `pathlib`, a module I use very frequently, and suddenly I stopped in my tracks and wondered how the module worked.

There are many modules in the standard library that are implemented in Python and you stand to learn a lot if you browse their source code.
If you're interested in metaprogramming and my talk left you longing for more, I can recommend you check the module `enum`, which relies on metaprogramming techniques and tools.

Thank you very much for your attention!
