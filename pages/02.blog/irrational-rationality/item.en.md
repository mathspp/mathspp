title: 'Twitter proof: irrational rationality'
---

Let's prove that there are two irrational numbers, call them $a$ and $b$, such that $a^b$ is a rational number! And let's do it in a tweet.

![the variable a raised to the power of b](atotheb.webp)

# Twitter proof

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter proof:<br>Let a=b=√2. If a^b is rational then there is nothing to be done. Assume a^b is irrational. Redefine a=√2^√2. Notice how a^b = (√2^√2)^√2 = (√2)^2 = 2 which is clearly rational.
