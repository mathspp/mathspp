# Problems

Blog posts with problems to get your brain going! You get a new problem every fortnight and the solutions are published later.

If you want the problems delivered to your inbox be sure to [subscribe to the Problems newsletter](http://eepurl.com/hf2ioP).

The next problem is scheduled for Sunday, 18th of October, around 19h GMT.

<sub><sup>You may notice some problems are missing... I'm still migrating articles from my [old blog](http://mathspp.blogspot.com).</sup></sub>
