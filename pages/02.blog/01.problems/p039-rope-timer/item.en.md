You have two magical ropes that you can set on fire and you need

# Problem statement

You are given two magic ropes and a lighter.
The ropes are magic because you are told they burn in a weird way:
each rope takes exactly 1 hour to burn from end to end,
but they don't burn at a constant rate.
(What that means is that the time elapsed doesn't have to be
proportional to the length of burnt rope.
For example, it may happen that the first half of the rope
takes 35 min to burn,
then a huge portion of the remaining rope burns in 10 min,
and then the final tip of the rope takes 15 min to burn.)

Given two magic ropes like this, how do you use them to measure 45 minutes?

!!! Give it some thought!
