This simple problem is an example of a very interesting phenomenon: if you have a large enough "universe" to consider, even randomly picked parts exhibit structured properties.

### Problem statement

Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. Then, consider the integers

$$
\{3, 4, \cdots, 2n-1, 2n\}\ .
$$

Show that, if you pick $n$ from those, you always have two numbers that will share no divisors whatsoever.

In other words, show that there's two of those $n$ numbers that are coprime.

!!! Give it some thought...
