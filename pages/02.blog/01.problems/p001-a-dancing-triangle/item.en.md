This post's format will be a bit different from the usual and the first of a series of posts of this type. In this post, I will state a problem and then present my solution.

### Problem statement

Let $[ABC]$ be any triangle. We now define a transformation of the triangle which moves one vertex and leaves the other two unchanged. To apply a transformation, start by picking the vertex you want to move. Assume it was $C$. Consider the line that goes through $C $ which is parallel to $[AB] $, and pick any point $C' $ in it. Your transformed triangle is $[ABC'] $. You can repeat this process as many times as you want.<br />
Can the original triangle be transformed into a triangle where all sides where doubled? How/why?

!!! Give it some thought...

If you need any clarification whatsoever, feel free to ask in the comment section below.
