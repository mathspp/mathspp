Alice and Bob sit across each other, ready for their game of coins.
Who will emerge victorious?

# Problem statement

Alice and Bob sit across each other at a circular table.
They will now play the “game of coins”!

The “game of coins” is simple:
they have access to a _huge_ pile of circular coins of the same size and,
in turns, they place a coin on the table.
That coin must not overlap with any other coins already placed; it must rest completely on the table.
The first player to not have enough room to place a coin, loses.

Alice will play first.

Can either of the two develop a winning strategy?
And what strategy would that be?

!!! Give it some thought!
