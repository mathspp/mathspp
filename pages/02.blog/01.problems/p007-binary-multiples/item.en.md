Is it true that every integer you can think of has a multiple written out only with $0$s and $1$s?

### Problem statement

Let $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ be an integer. Is there an integer $n$ such that $n$ is a multiple of $k$ and $n$ only has $0$s and $1$s in its decimal expansion?

As an example, if $k = 2$ we could have $n = 10$.

!!! Give it some thought...
