# Introduction

The [dunder method][dunder-methods] `__init__` is probably the first dunder method that Python programmers learn about.
When you first start defining your own classes, you are taught that you need to initialise your objects inside this crazy magic method called `__init__`,
and you don't really understand why that method has such a weird name.

When I first learned about `__init__`, I thought it was this magical method that worked in an obscure way...
But that is not true!
In what follows, I will try to demystify what `__init__` does and how it works.

# What is `__init__` for?

**The dunder method `__init__` is the method of your class that is responsible for initialising your object upon creation.**
Just like the diagram above hints at, your method `__init__` receives a fresh new instance of your class,
and it is at that point that you are free to customise it and adapt it,
according to the arguments that were passed in when the first instance was created.

For example, suppose you are a freelancer and you want to create a simple system to keep track of all your clients.
Maybe you would create a class `Client`,
and each client would have some information associated with them,
say, their name and their email.

Thus, to create a new instance of `Client`, you would need to pass in the name and email:

```py
class Client:
    # ...

# Create two clients:
alice = Client("Alice", "alice@example.com")
bob = Client("Bob", "bob@example.com")
```

The rationale is that both the name and the email of the client stay associated with that object,
and you associate those things to the objects **when you initialise them**.

Let us take a closer look at the line that creates the client Alice:

```py
alice = Client("Alice", "alice@example.com")
```

Notice that `__init__` does not show up in that line.
And yet, when that line runs, the dunder method `__init__` will be called...
And it will be given **three** pieces of information!
Obviously, the dunder method `__init__` will receive the string name and the string email,
but there is one extra piece of information that `__init__` will receive and that will actually come first.


# `self`

The extra piece of information that `__init__` receives is the _object_ that `__init__` is actually initialising!

Recall that `__init__` is supposed to **initialise your object upon creation**,
so Python will create a blank `Client` object,
and then it will give it to you.
The dunder method `__init__` accepts that blank `Client` object,
and that is what makes it possible for you to attach the `name` and `email` strings
as attributes of that instance.

The diagram below depicts this:
the blank cube goes into `__init__`, just like the string `name` and the string `email`.
It is the dunder method `__init__` that actually puts the three together.

![A blank cube, representing an instance of `Person`, is passed to the dunder method `__init__`, which is then responsible for initialising the instance with the information provided by the other arguments.](__init__.png "Diagram representing the arguments to `__init__`.")

Notice that I called the blank `Person` argument `self`, and that is just a [Python naming convention][naming-matters#self].
(It is a deeply ingrained convention,
so you will definitely shock everyone around you if you change that name,
but it is just a name like any other.
You can change it to whatever you would like!)

What is interesting and ‚Äúmagical‚Äù is that we do not have to worry about passing that blank cube/blank instance of `Person` to the dunder method `__init__` as the argument `self`,
it is Python that handles that on the backstage!

Taking all this into account,
the implementation of `Client` could look something like this:

```py
class Client:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        print(f"Creating the client {name} with email {email}.")
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

# Create two clients:
alice = Client("Alice", "alice@example.com")
# Creating the client Alice with email alice@example.com.
bob = Client("Bob", "bob@example.com")
# Creating the client Bob with email bob@example.com.
```

Notice that the prints inside `__init__` were triggered but we **did not** call the method `__init__` explicitly.
The dunder method `__init__` was called implicitly as part of the process of creating and customising each of the `Client` instances.

As in the example above, it is very _common_ for the dunder method `__init__` to save some/all of the arguments as attributes of the instance.
This makes that information available for later, so that the program/other methods can access it.
In fact, let us extend our class `Client` so that we can send emails to clients:

```py
class Client:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        print(f"Creating the client {name} with email {email}.")
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def send_email(self, email_body):
        print(f"To: {self.name} <{self.email}>")
        print(email_body)

alice = Client("Alice", "alice@example.com")
# Creating the client Alice with email alice@example.com
alice.send_email("We need to schedule a meeting!")
# To: Alice <alice@example.com>
# We need to schedule a meeting!
```


# Introductory `__init__` exercises

Here are a few exercises to help you come to grips with `__init__`.

 1. Implement a class `Person` that accepts a string argument `name` and saves it as an attribute.
    1. Add a method `greet` that prints a greeting with that person's name.
 2. Implement a class `FullNamePerson` that accepts string arguments `first_name` and `last_name` and saves them in a single attribute `full_name`.
    1. Add two methods to that class, one to retrieve the first name from the full name and another one to retrieve the last name from the full name.
 3. Implement a class `Point2D` that accepts two numeric arguments `x` and `y` but then saves them in a single tuple attribute.
 4. Create an instance of `Point2D` with arguments `0` and `0` and call it `point`.
    1. Print the tuple attribute with the two zeroes.
    2. Try calling the method `__init__` on `point` directly, as if it were any other method; this time, pass in other arguments.
    3. Print the tuple attribute again. What do you see?
 5. Go ahead and modify `Person.__init__` so that the first argument is not `self`, then verify your code still works.

If some of the exercises are not clear, be sure to let me know, so that I can improve the wording!


# `__init__` and inheritance

Sometimes, our classes inherit from other classes,
which means we get to reuse some of the behaviour they already define.
When we inherit from another class, we have to be careful when initialising the subclass instance:
we need to make sure that the parent class(es) get to do their initialisation!
If that doesn't happen, things will be missing!

Let's go back to our `Client` class, which could be a subclass of `Person`.
If we assume all our clients are humans, that makes total sense.
Here is that relationship in code:

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Client(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def send_email(self, email_body):
        print(f"To: {self.name} <{self.email}>")
        print(email_body)
```

Now, the issue is that there is duplication in the two dunder methods `__init__`:
in `Person.__init__` and in `Client.__init__`.
To be honest, it isn't much: it's just the assignment to `self.name`...
But duplication is something to avoid.
What is more, we could easily extend the initialisation of the class `Person`,
and then `Client` would have to keep up...
And if we subclass `Person` or `Client` even further,
that is just going to become even messier.

To fix this, the subclass must call explicitly the dunder method `__init__` of the parent class,
and that is done with the help of the built-in `super`,
which exists precisely to help us reach out to methods from parent classes!

By using `super`, here is how we would fix the implementation of `Client.__init__`:

```py
class Person:
    # ...

class Client(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.email = email

    # ...
```

How does this work?
Think of it this way:
`super()` gives us access to the methods (dunder, or not) of the parent class,
so, after calling `super()`, it's as if we were looking at the ‚Äúperson‚Äù side of the client we are initialising.
Then, we call its `__init__` method to do the initialisation that instances of `Person` need.
To do that, we need to provide the arguments that `Person` expects, which is just the `name`.

It is only after doing the parent class initialisation that we should do our own initialisation,
and that is why we only save the attribute `self.email` after calling `super().__init__`.
This order can be quite important, so, as a rule of thumb, it is always a good idea to **start by initialising the parent class,
and only then the subclass**.

In the exercises that follow, you will find a situation where ordering matters.


# `__init__` and inheritance exercises

 6. Create a class `Point` that is the parent class of `Point2D`:
    1. `Point` accepts a single argument: an iterable (a list or a tuple, for example) with numbers and saves it in a tuple attribute.
    2. `Point2D` still accepts two arguments, but its initialisation is now done completely through the parent class `__init__`.
 7. Modify the class `Client` to accept a third argument, `nice`, which is a Boolean that says if the client is nice or not.
    1. Create two subclasses of `Client`, `NiceClient` and `ObnoxiousClient`, that only need the arguments `name` and `email`. When calling the parent class `__init__`, you should fill in the Boolean argument `nice` yourself.

This exercise shows that creating subclasses doesn't necessarily mean that you are **adding** arguments.
Sometimes, you **remove** arguments because some of them become implied.

 8. Modify the dunder method `__init__` on `Person`, `Client`, and `NiceClient`/`ObnoxiousClient` to include a call to the function `print` that just says you are inside the respective `__init__`, then create an instance of `NiceClient`/`ObnoxiousClient`. What do you see?
