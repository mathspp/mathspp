Let me show you how to do function composition through operator overloading, and other cool tricks!

===

Here is some Python 🐍 code using

 - decorators
 - callable classes
 - custom operators
 - “functional” function composition
 - arbitrary args and kwargs

```py
>>> class F:
...     def __init__(self, f):
...         self.f = f
...     def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
...         return self.f(*args, **kwargs)
...     def __or__(self, other):
...         return F(lambda *args, **kwargs: other(self(*args, **kwargs)))
...
>>> @F
... def add_two(n):
...     return n + 2
...
>>> @F
... def divide_3_floor(n):
...     return n // 3
...
>>> s = F(str)
>>> f = add_two | divide_3_floor | s
>>> f(7)
'3'
```

Here is a breakdown of everything that is going on 👇


Let us start... from the end!

```py
>>> f = add_two | divide_3_floor | s
>>> f(7)
'3'
```

The assignment to `f` takes 3 functions:

 - `add_two`
 - `divide_3_floor`
 - `s`

and then combines them.

The `|` is in charge of doing this combination, but what combination is this?


The `|` is doing some “magic” I asked it to do, this is not default behaviour in Python.

`f = g | h` means that the function `f` corresponds to calling `h` after calling `g`.

So, `f(x)` actually means `h(g(x))`.


In my code, I wrote `f = add_two | divide_3_floor | s`.

So, when I write `f(7)`, it actually means something else:

```py
>>> f = add_two | divide_3_floor | s
>>> f(7)
'3'
>>> s(divide_3_floor(add_two(7)))
'3'
```


Formally speaking, the operator pipe `|` is being used to do function composition.

In other words, by using `|` I have another way of composing functions in a convenient way.

But I lied 😅 `add_two`, `divide_3_floor`, and `s`, aren't “functions” per se...


Did you notice how I defined `s`?

```py
s = F(str)
```

I created `s` by taking the built-in `str` and putting it through `F`.

But what IS `F`?

It's just a class I created, right?

But it's a very special class 😉


The class `F` only expects an argument `f`.

```py
class F:
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f = f
    # ...
```

I used a lowercase `f`, not because I wanted to be mysterious, but because `f` is mathematician-speak for a function.

So, to create an instance of `F`, I just feed it a function.

So, `s = F(str)` creates an `F` out of `str`.


Then, the instance of `F` just stores that function in `self.f`.

Why?

For later use 🙃

The idea is that instances of `F` **behave** like the functions passed in originally.

So, if an instance of `F` must behave like a function, it must be callable.

Call-huh?


In other words, after I write `s = F(str)`, I need to be able to write `s(...)`.

I need to be able to call `s` (hence, callable).

That is why I needed to implement the dunder method `__call__`.

```py
class F:
    # ...
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.f(*args, **kwargs)
    # ...
```

The dunder method `__call__` is responsible for making instances of `F` callable.


So, what's the behaviour of `s` when we call it with `s(...)`?

To understand that, we need to look at `__call__`.

First, let us understand the signature:

```py
def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # ...
```

What do the `*args*` and `**kwargs` do?

Think with me:

Instances of `F` must act like the original functions, right?


But the original functions might be **arbitrary** functions, right?

The original function can be a function with 0 or 3 arguments.

It can be a function with an argument called `this_is_just_an_argument`.

We can't _guess_ how many/what arguments we'll have...


So, we have to plan for _any_ and _all_ cases!

How do we do that?

With `*args` and `**kwargs`.

By using `*args`, a function can receive however many **positional** arguments:

```py
>>> def func_with_args(*args):
...     print(args)
...
>>> func_with_args()
()
>>> func_with_args(15, True)
(15, True)
```


Similarly, by using `**kwargs`, a function can receive however many **keyword** arguments:

```py
>>> def func_with_kwargs(**kwargs):
...     print(kwargs)
...
>>> func_with_kwargs(a=15, b=True)
{'a': 15, 'b': True}
>>> func_with_kwargs()
{}
```

Oh, by the way, here is an important remark:


This cool behaviour comes from using `*` and `**` on the left of the parameters.

The words `args` and `kwargs` are just the common choice in Python!

We can pick other names:

```py
>>> def func_with_args_kwargs(*banana, **split):
...     print(banana)
...     print(split)
...
>>> func_with_args_kwargs()
()
{}
>>> func_with_args_kwargs(15, True, stuff=None, info="hey")
(15, True)
{'stuff': None, 'info': 'hey'}
```


Now we can understand the signature of `__call__`:

`def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs)`

But there is more!

What about the body of the definition?

Why do we use `*args` and `**kwargs` again..?

```py
class F:
    # ...
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.f(*args, **kwargs)
    # ...
```


By using `*args` and `**kwargs` again, we are trying to unpack the arguments we got so far.

By unpacking those arguments, we pass them down to `self.f`, which is the original function:

```py
>>> s = F(str)
>>> s(15)
'15'
```

Can you trace the journey that the `15` makes?


One good thing you can do is modify `__call__` to print `args` and `kwargs` before the `return`.

That will help you visualise things!

It's also something I do very often:

I tweak the code I'm studying to see what is really going on.


Now we know what is going on with `__call__`...

But what's up with `__or__`..?

The dunder method `__or__` is what is called when we use `|` next to instances of `F`.

But what gives?


By implementing `__or__`, we hijack the operator `|` and we get to use it for whatever we want!

In this case, we want `|` to be able to combine instances of `F` with each other.

How do we do that?

“Simple”:


Remember that `F`s are supposed to look like functions.

When we combine two `F`s, we want to create a new one that represents the two `F`s in succession.

Let us use the built-ins `int` and `bin` to see what happens when we do `F(int) | F(bin)`.

```py
>>> int("15")  # String to integer.
15
>>> bin(15)    # Integer to binary representation.
'0b1111'
```


When we write `F(int) | F(bin)`, we want to combine the `F(int)` with the `F(bin)`.

Also, when we write `F(int) | F(bin)`, the dunder `__or__` is called.

When that happens, we go inside the `__or__` that looks like this:

```py
class F:
    # ...
    def __or__(self, other):
        return F(lambda *args, **kwargs: other(self(*args, **kwargs)))
```

What's what?


Inside `__or__`, after writing `F(int) | F(bin)`, these are the arguments:

 - `self` is `F(int)`; and
 - `other` is `F(bin)`.

We want the combination to be an `F` that calls `bin` after calling `int`:

```py
>>> int_then_bin = F(int) | F(bin)
>>> int_then_bin("15")
'0b1111'
```

We want the function inside `other` after the function inside `self`.


And we want the whole thing to be an `F`.

Why?

So that we can later combine that _again_ if we want to!

That explains part of what is going on:

```py
class F:
    # ...
    def __or__(self, other):
        return F(...other(self(...)))
```


What are we missing?

Not too much, now!

Remember how instances of `F` are created?

We need to feed `F` with a function.

So, in order to combine `F(int)` with `F(bin)`, which are `self` and `other`, respectively, we need to wrap them in a function.


We could define a regular function with `def` and whatnot, but I opted for something leaner.

By using a `lambda`, I can write a function that wraps `self` and `other`:

```py
>>> self = F(int)
>>> other = F(bin)
>>> func = lambda *args, **kwargs: other(self(*args, **kwargs))
>>> func("15")
'0b1111'
```


In the end, we just add the `F` around that so that the lambda can also be combined with other things.

The lambda, by itself, is a regular lambda.

If I put it inside an `F`, we get one of these cool things that can be combined with each other:

```py
>>> self = F(int)
>>> other = F(bin)
>>> func = lambda *args, **kwargs: other(self(*args, **kwargs))
>>> func
<function <lambda> at 0x000001E60733E940>
>>> F(func)
<__main__.F object at 0x000001E6073169D0>
```


The final piece of the puzzle is the `@F` on top of the definitions of `add_two` and `divide_3_floor`:

```py
>>> @F
... def add_two(n):
...     return n + 2
...
>>> @F
... def divide_3_floor(n):
...     return n // 3
...
```

By using the keyword `def` I can create regular Python functions, right?

But I want these to be cool functions I can combine.

So, they need to go through `F`.

But how?


They could've gone through `F` like `str` did:

```py
>>> def add_two(n):
...     return n + 2
...
>>> add_two = F(add_two)
>>> def divide_3_floor(n):
...     return n // 3
...
>>> divide_3_floor = F(divide_3_floor)
```

Because I only care about the cool version of these functions, I can reuse the same name.

(For `s` and `str` I used two names: `s = F(str)`.)


Now, take a look at the pattern that emerges!

I took the functions `add_two` and `divide_3_floor` and tweaked them.

Instead of letting them be vanilla functions, I added some functionality.

I decorated them with some bells and whistles.

I **decorated** them...


This is the pattern of decorators!

Instead of doing the final assignment by hand, after making the functions go through `F`, I can just write `@F` at the top.

By writing the `@F`, Python does that assignment for me.


This is a lot to digest!

My number 1 advice?

Write the code and play with it.

Add prints.

Test your understanding.

Here are some of the things we have seen:

 - callable classes
 - custom operators for classes (the `|`)
 - decorators (and classes as decorators)
 - `*args` and `**kwargs`
 - function composition
 - lambdas
 - and more!

But wait, there is even MORE!

My original snippet of code wasn't like this.

There was a subtle (but not so subtle!) difference.

Here is the original code: https://twitter.com/mathsppblog/status/1512495768300572674

Can you spot the differences?

Can you explain them?

Hint: look at the final result.
