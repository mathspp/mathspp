This short article shows how to use the module `bisect` from the Python standard library.

Are you familiar with the module `bisect` from the Python üêç standard library?

It is a small module to help you work with sorted lists.
If you have a sorted list and a new value, you can find the index where the new value would go by using the method `bisect`:

```py
>>> value = 22
>>> ordered_values = [1, 5, 19, 23]
# `value` would go at index 3 -^

>>> import bisect
>>> bisect.bisect(ordered_values, value)
3  # the index where `value` would go

>>> ordered_values.insert(3, value)
>>> ordered_values
[1, 5, 19, 22, 23]
```

The function `bisect` tells you where a value _would_ go...
But if you want to insert it, `bisect` can also do that for you!
Just use the method `insort`:

```py
>>> ordered_values
[1, 5, 19, 22, 23]

# Let's add 21 in there, preserving the order:
>>> bisect.insort(ordered_values, 21)
>>> ordered_values
[1, 5, 19, 21, 22, 23]
```

The module `bisect` has four more methods: `bisect_left`, `bisect_right`, `insort_left`, and `insort_right`...

The `_left` and `_right` where to place ties (elements that are equal).

The methods `bisect` and `insort` match their `_right` variants.
