In this short article I describe how to simplify equality comparisons chained with the operator `or`.

Do you want to check if a Python üêç variable matches one of several possible values?
Instead of writing a big chain of `or` and equalities `==`, use the `in` operator!

```py
>>> x = 43
>>> if x == 42 or x == 43 or x == 44:
...     print("Nice!")
...
Nice!
>>> if x in (42, 43, 44):
...     print("Nice!")
...
Nice!
```


Using `in` is a great tip but it isn't always a suitable alternative!
The operator `or` short-circuits, which means it stops comparing as soon as it finds a `True`.
This isn't the case if you use `in`:

```py
>>> def f():
...     return 42
...
>>> def g():
...     return 43
...
>>> def h():
...     return 1 / 0
...
>>> if x == f() or x == g() or x == h():
...     print("Nice!")
...
Nice!
>>> if x in (f(), g(), h()):
...     print("Nice!")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in h
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
