# Problem statement

This is a harder variant of the [8 queens][8-queens] problem.
As a warm-up for _this_ problem, consider solving that one first!

For the “queens and knights” problem,
you want to place as many queens and knights, as possible, on a chessboard.
However, queens and knights must be placed in equal numbers,
and no piece can attack any other piece.

While you are at it, can you do it in multiple ways?

For reference, here is a picture showing what squares a queen attacks:

Similarly, here is a picture showing what squares a knight attacks:

!!! Give it some thought!
