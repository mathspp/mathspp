Can you tile a chessboard with two missing squares?

# Problem statement

If you remove two opposite corners of a chessboard,
can you still tile it with 2 x 1 rectangles?

In other words, looking at the image above,
can you cover the whole chessboard with 2 x 1 domino tiles,
_except_ for the top-left and bottom-right corners?
