Can you make the pyramid point the other way by moving only three coins?

# Problem statement

The image above shows a pyramid composed of 10 coins:
4 coins, then 3, then 2, then 1.

Your task is to make the pyramid point the other way by moving
_only_ three coins.

In the image above, that means you want the pyramid to be pointing to the left.

With a figure, if the initial pyramid is

```txt
O O O O
 O O O
  O O
   O
```

you have to make it look like

```txt
   O
  O O 
 O O O
O O O O
```

Again, only moving 3 coins.

The purpose of the puzzle is not for you to find a loophole in the instructions.

!!! Give it some thought!

# Solution

It is easier to _show_ you the solution than it is to explain it to you,
but what you want to do is take the three corner coins and “move them to the opposite side”:
