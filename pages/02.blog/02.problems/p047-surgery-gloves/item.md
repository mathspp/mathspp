# Problem statement

Alice and Bob are a bit sick,
and they need to undergo surgery.
Both of them need something done to their stomach and their heart.

Unfortunately, the hospital is severely underfunded and only has two pairs
of latex gloves at their disposal.

How can Charles and Diana (respectively the stomach and heart surgeons) operate,
knowing that

 - the gloves that touch one doctor's skin cannot touch the other doctor's skin; and
 - the gloves that touch one patient's blood cannot touch the other patient's blood?

Sadly, washing the gloves is out of the question,
because the hospital has no means of properly sanitising the gloves!


!!! Give it some thought!
