I mixed up my hamburgers while cooking. Can you help me out?

===

This post's problem is brought to you by my struggles while cooking.
I bought 4 raw chicken hamburgers; two of them were plain chicken burgers, the other two were already seasoned, "american-style" (whatever that meant).
In practice, I could tell them apart because the american-style burgers were orange and the plain chicken burgers were light-pink_ish_.

I had never had one of those "american-style" (AS) burgers and I was slightly afraid I wouldn't enjoy them, so I decided I would have half of a regular burger and half of the AS burger for dinner.

I started cooking the burgers, and at some point I couldn't tell them apart by colour any more, as you can see in the picture below: they all looked the same colour!

![Four hamburgers of two different types indistinguishable by colour.](_burgers.webp "My four burgers.")

I panicked a little bit.
How can I be sure that for my dinner I will only have half of a regular burger and half of an AS burger? Of course in my mind I couldn't just take a bite of each, because that is not mathematical, so I had to come up with some way of doing it!
(As sad as it might be, this is a true story...)


# Problem statement

Given 4 perfectly identical, indistinguishable hamburgers (2 regular burgers and 2 AS burgers), how can I come up with a way of serving them, such that I am able to guarantee that on my plate I have exactly half of a regular burger and exactly half of an AS burger?


# Solution

Slice each hamburger in four. Serve yourself a quarter of each hamburger.
Now you have half of a regular burger on your plate and half of an AS burger.
Easy, right?

This burger dilemma turns out to be equivalent to another logic riddle I was told.
In this riddle, a man is in a deserted island with 4 pills: two pills of type $A$ and two pills of type $B$.
Both types of pills are, of course, perfectly indistinguishable.
The man needs to take 1 pill of each type right now, or he will die.
He must take them at the same time and the dosage must be exactly this: 1 pill of each type.
How can he do that?

The solution is _pretty similar_ to that of my hamburger dilemma:
break each pill into half; from each whole pill, take one of the halves in your hand.
Take those 4 halves all at the same time.
This works because among the 4 halves, the man will be holding two halves from a type $A$ pill and two halves from a type $B$ pill.
