# Purpose

This workshop has the purpose of helping the participants explore problems
in the area of bioinformatics, which are typically biology problems
that are tackled with the power of computers.


# Content

A session consists of tackling, as a group, a pre-selected series of problems from
sources such as [Rosalind][rosalind].
Problems can be picked in such a way that they fall into a more specific subset
of bioinformatics.
For example, for the course whose poster I include below, the problems selected
were all related to DNA.

In my opinion, this workshop becomes really interesting if we use APL as the
programming language in which we solve the problems,
but the workshop can be led in any programming language.
In the “Is Python in your DNA?” session we used Python.

If you have any questions feel free to leave them below in the comments,
or [email me][mailme] if you prefer!


# Previous sessions

 - I have given this workshop at the [6th Bioengineering Week][bioengineering-week],
on the 9th of March of 2021,
as part of a week-long event on the subject of – you guessed it – bioengineering.
This event was prepared by students from degrees related to bioengineering at my old university.
