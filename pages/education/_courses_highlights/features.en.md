# Courses

Be it in the span of a couple of days or spread throughout weeks
or months, the courses I teach are aimed at getting you to *understand*
how things work.
We start with the basics, building the knowledge from the ground up,
and always using it to build something: it is only when you build something,
when you use your knowledge to do something, that you really take it in.

Feel free to [email me][email] if you would like to know more.
You can also have a look at [the courses][courses] I already have prepared and/or given,
in case you are curious.
