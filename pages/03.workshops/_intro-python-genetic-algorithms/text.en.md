menu: Intro Python genetic algorithms
---

The aim of this workshop is to introduce people to programming. Instead of introducing the concepts point-blank, we use genetic algorithms as a motivation for the concepts taught.

We will start with robots that clean rooms in a random fashion, like the one on the left, and try to improve those into robots like the one on the right.
