# Introduction to LaTeX

## Aim

The aim of this workshop is to introduce people to typesetting with LaTeX. LaTeX is a system that allows one to write some commands that are then rendered as formulas.

As an example, `$x^2$` gets rendered as $x^2$. In a mathematics course it turns out to be very helpful to know how to use LaTeX decently. The workshop just gives an overview of the type of things that can be done and that we, as maths students, eventually need to use.

I always point the students to these _really_ helpful resources:

 - The [Overleaf][overleaf] website, where one can create LaTeX documents online and edit them collaboratively and online;
 - The [latex.stackexchange][latexse] website, where I search for how to do X or Y, whenever I want to do something that is not immediately obvious;
 - The [codecogs][codecogs] site, where one can typeset formulas and check if the result is making any sense. It also has a nice palette of frequently-used symbols, so that we don't have to type them out;
 - The [detexify][detexify] website, very helpful when you know how to draw a symbol but don't know its name;
 - [This website][tables] that makes it easier to create table.
