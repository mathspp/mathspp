# Recreational maths

In my workshop on recreational maths I expose students to deceptively simple puzzles they are already familiar with and that they can solve.

Then I show them similar puzzles that still look really simple but that they can't solve. They don't know that yet, so I usually have them attempt the puzzles on the board and argue if the puzzles are solvable or not, and why/why not.

Then I show them how mathematics can be used to **prove** those puzzles are unsolvable!

And the best thing is, it is even more fun than what I made it sound like!

You can read more about the workshop and the type of puzzles I present [here](../recreational-maths).
