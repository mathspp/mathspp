# Introduction to LaTeX

You can think of LaTeX as Microsoft Word for mathematicians. With LaTeX we can typeset weird, complicated formulas and make them look nice.

A subset of LaTeX commands can even be used in this site: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \iff x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

Nowadays we can even use LaTeX over at Facebook Messenger (even though it doesn't work on mobile phones): try sending `$$x^2 - 1 = 0$$` to someone, and see it become $x^2 - 1 = 0$.
